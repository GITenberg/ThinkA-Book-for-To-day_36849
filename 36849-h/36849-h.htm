<h2>PUBLISHER'S NOTE</h2>


<p>When Colonel Hunter wrote PEP in 1914 and
offered it to The Reilly &amp; Britton Company, we
immediately accepted the manuscript for publication.
So highly did we regard the work that
the president of this company, over his signature,
contributed an introductory note of endorsement,
citing his own experience in following the
rules and principles laid down in PEP for the
attainment of "poise, efficiency and peace."</p>

<p>Our confidence and belief in PEP were amply
justified. Eight large editions were printed in
four years. Over 70,000 copies have been sold.</p>

<p>THINK&mdash;the last book that Colonel Hunter
wrote&mdash;is now published for the first time. It
is especially important, coming, as it does, at a
time when commonsense thinking, good health,
good cheer, optimism and rational methods of
living are more necessary than ever before.</p>

<p>In this trenchantly written volume, Colonel
Hunter has given some golden advice to the man
or woman who is facing the big problems of
to-day in a wavering or hopeless spirit. Correct
your thinking. Get a grip on yourself. Colonel
Hunter tells you how.</p>

<h2>1.</h2>


<p>We all enter the world with an abundance of
nerve energy, and by conserving that energy we
can adapt and adjust our nerve equipment to
keep pace with the progress and evolution of
our times.</p>

<p>The way to preserve and conserve nerve equilibrium
and power is to rest and relax the nerves
each day.</p>

<p>You may rest them by a change of the thought
habit each day, by relaxation, by sleep, and by
the suggestions made in this book.</p>

<p>There are but few advance danger signals
shown by the nervous system, and in this there is
a marked difference between the nerves and the
organic system.</p>

<p>If you abuse your stomach, head, heart, lungs,
liver, kidneys or eyes, you have distress and pain.</p>

<p>The nervous energy is like a barrel of water&mdash;you
can draw water from the faucet at the bot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>tom
until you have almost exhausted the contents.</p>

<p>Nature mends ordinary nerve waste each day,
like the rains replenish the cistern.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conserve
Your
Energy.</div>

<p>A reasonable use of your nerve force, like a
reasonable use of the rainwater, means you can
maintain a permanent supply. But
you must be reasonable; you must
give the cistern a chance to refill and
replace that which you have drawn out.</p>

<p>You, who have shattered and tattered your
nerves, are not hopeless. You can come back,
but it must be done by complete change of the
acts that brought on the condition.</p>

<p>Get more sleep. Eliminate the useless, harmful
fads, fancies and functions which disturbed
and prevented you from living a sane, rational
life.</p>

<p>Avoid extremes, cultivate rhythm and regularity
in your business and your home life. Keep
away from excitement. Read really good books.
Walk more, talk less.</p>

<p>Eat less heat-making foods and more apples.
Follow the diet, exercise and thought rules suggested
in "Pep."</p>

<div class="sidenote">No Need
to Despair.</div>

<p>Maybe these lines are being read by a discouraged
one who is "all nerves," which means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
lost nerve force. To you I say there
is hope and cheer and strength and
courage if, right here, now, you resolve
to cut the actions, habits and stunts that
knocked you out and follow my suggestions.</p>

<p>I know, my friend, for I've trotted the heat,
danced the measure, and been through the mill.</p>

<p>Now I am fearless, calm and prepared. I can
stand any calamity, meet any issue, endure any
sorrow.</p>

<p>I can do prodigious work in an emergency, go
without rest or eating when required, because I
have poise, efficiency&mdash;peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Steer a
Middle
Course.</div>

<p>I realize nothing is as bad as it is painted.
Nothing is as good as its boosters claim. I go
in the middle of the road, avoiding
extremes. I have confidence in my
heart. Courage, hope, happiness, and
content attend me on my way.</p>

<p>I've buried envy in a deep pit and covered
it with quick lime.</p>

<p>I am keeping worry out by keeping faith, hope
and cheer thoughts in my brain-room, and these
are antiseptics against the ravages of the worry
microbe.</p>

<p>I have my petty troubles and little make-believe
worries, just enough of them to make me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
realize I have them licked, and to remind me I
must not let up on my mastery of them.</p>

<p>Worry growls once in a while just to make
me grab tighter the handle of my whip.</p>

<p>And you may enjoy this serene state, too.
There is no secret about it. I will gladly give
you the rules of the game in this book. Just
prepare to receive some practical, helpful suggestions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<h2>2.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">How to
Use Your
Assets.</div>

<p>You are a busy person, so am I. Busy persons
are the ones who do things. The architect
is a busy man, but he has learned that
the effort spent in preparing his
plans is the most important part of
his work. The plans enable him to do his work
systematically and lay down rules and methods
to get the highest efficiency and accomplishment
from those who do the work of erecting the building.</p>

<p>If the architect would order lumber, stone and
hardware, without system, and start to erect the
building without carefully prepared plans, the
building would lack symmetry and strength, and
it would be most expensive.</p>

<p>The planning time therefor was time well spent.</p>

<p>Few persons have the ability to control and
conserve their talents so as to produce the highest
efficiency. Men rush along thinking their
busyness means business. Really, it means
double energy and extra moves to produce a
given effect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Unnecessary
Moves.</div>

<p>The elimination of unnecessary moves means
operating along lines of least resistance, and any
plan or method that will help to do
away with unnecessary moves and
make the necessary moves more
potential will be received with welcome, I am
sure.</p>

<p>With the object of conserving energy and
strengthening your force, this book is written.</p>

<p>It shall not be a book of ultimate definiteness
or a book of exact science. There are no definite
or exact rules that will apply, without exception,
to any science except mathematics.</p>

<p>But we shall learn many helpful truths, nevertheless,
and if I err, or disagree with your conclusions,
just eliminate those lines and take the
helps you find.</p>

<p>I particularly emphasize the importance of
taking a few minutes each evening and using
the time for sizing up things, by inventory, analysis,
speculation, comparison and hypothesis.
Many of the great captains of industry who are
noted for their energy in accomplishing things
worth while, have learned the value of this daily
habit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Know
Thyself.</div>

<p>I want to help YOU to form the habit of
thinking over each day's activities in the quiet,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>relaxed, uncolored, unprejudiced, secluded
environment of your home.
When the day's work is over, spend
fifteen or twenty minutes each evening in seclusion,
and with closed eyes, size yourself up.
Think over your daily round and the work you
are doing. Are you getting the best out of yourself?
Or are you plodding along aimlessly, scattering
your energy in a haphazard, hit-or-miss
fashion that benefits nobody? Are you growing,
or are you standing still? In these fifteen-minute
sizing-up sessions, you will come to grips with
yourself. You will see yourself as you really are,
and will discover your weaknesses, your strength,
your real worth.</p>

<p>I have chosen the evening as the time for our
little talks. In the evening we can be cozy,
comfy and communicative. The bank is closed.
We met the note and got through the day. We
are alive and well; we can open our hearts.
There is no office boy to disturb us, and the life
insurance agent is away at his club.</p>

<p>Yes, we can be alone and tranquilly let down
the tension, lower the speed and with normal
heartbeats play the low tones, the soft strains,
the quieting music, and soothe our nerves.</p>

<p>All day we've heard the band with its drums<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and trombones and shrieky music. The day with
its busy whirl kept our analyzing mental think-tank
occupied with thoughts of gain and game
and fame.</p>

<p>In the evening we have time to study logic and
to reason, to analyze and to take inventory, to
thresh out problems.</p>

<p>So let us relax and reflect in the evening quiet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 100%;" />
<h2>3.</h2>


<p>Man's nature makes it imperative for him to
be interested in something.</p>

<p>That interest is to his help or hurt, according
as he directs it.</p>

<p>There is much worry and misery in the world
because so many are astatic, like a compass that
has lost its loadstone.</p>

<p>Man is definitely the result of the materials the
body and the mind feed upon.</p>

<p>Character is the result of a determined purpose
to be and to do right&mdash;to one's self and to
one's fellows.</p>

<p>The man of character focuses his attention on
truth, and on fact.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theory and
Fact.</div>

<p>He uses theories with fact, to aid his progress,
but he recognizes that theorizing, without fact
as a safety ballast, is a useless expenditure.
Theories without fact
leave man in a rudderless boat; he
gets nowhere, he merely drifts.</p>

<p>Theory often helps to get at fact, but the better
way is to get at fact by proven experience,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
of which there is an inexhaustible abundance in
the world.</p>

<p>Facts are based on natural laws. The study of
natural laws is beneficial. We shall strive in our
studies to keep close to fact with just enough
speculation to enliven the interest in facts.</p>

<p>Living the artificial life makes for worry, illness
and failure.</p>

<p>Living in harmony with the great natural laws
is the helpful way to live.</p>

<p>To abide by the law is safety; to violate the
law brings punishment.</p>

<p>Every man is better if he follows scientific
methods and habits of thought and living.</p>

<p>The loafing or astatic mind will fall into morbid
tendencies.</p>

<p>The employed, truth-seeking, idealistic, hopeful
mind is never dependent on people or things
for its pleasure.</p>

<p>The acquiring of helpful knowledge, the seeking
of worth-while truth, are ever profitable employments,
paying present and future dividends,
and meanwhile those acts positively divert the
thought from morbid tendencies.</p>

<p>I shall strive to bring helpful knowledge, good
cheer and interesting facts for your present occupation
and benefit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>If I succeed in accomplishing my purpose, even
in part, my time has been well spent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thought
Never Stops.</div>

<p>We have an unchallenged fact to rest our feet
on, a fact that shall follow us through all the
pages of this book, and that is: Our
thoughts never stop, our brains never
sleep. So then, we must consider that
thought current, and reckon with it.</p>

<p>The motive power is turned on, and we must
grasp the helm if we sail the sea of life successfully,
baffling storms and avoiding rocks.</p>

<p>Scientific books are usually dry, uninviting
reading; they lack the human interest. They are
generally bloodless skeletons.</p>

<p>We shall try to weave science into new patterns
and paint interesting pictures, so that science
will attract and not repel.</p>

<p>This book is different in its suggestions, in
its prescriptions, in its language, but it is universal
with all scientific books, in that its aim
is helpful truth.</p>

<p>We go by different routes, but our objective
point is the same.</p>

<p>We will avoid technical names and symbols,
and will speak the common language that the
multitude understands.</p>

<p>We shall deal with problems and aspirations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
that come to us all in this busy workaday world.</p>

<p>We shall try to cut the underbrush in the
swamp and blaze a plain trail out on to the big
high road.</p>

<p>We shall keep in step to the drum-beats of
truth, we will rest and recreate in cool shady
places, and then up and on to our purpose with
smiles on our faces, courage in our hearts, and
song on our lips.</p>

<p>Every moment of our journey will be worth
while and positively helpful if we take the trip
with conscientious application and continuity of
purpose.</p>

<p>Our path is strewn with roses and thorns; we
must enjoy the roses and escape the thorns.</p>

<p>We welcome you, the neophyte, who have
joined us in our pilgrimage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<h2>4.</h2>


<p>Let's be personal; that's a good way to establish
a good idea in place of a bad one.</p>

<p>Are YOU pleasant to live with? Keep this
personal question before you, even if you are
cocksure that you can answer, yes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Be
Pleasant.</div>

<p>Maybe there are some little jars, rattles, gratings,
you are not aware of. Few of us are honest
when looking for our own faults.
There may be some sand in your gear
box. It won't hurt you to keep the
personal question alive for a few days,&mdash;"Am I
pleasant to live with?"</p>

<p>I love the pleasant people whether they are
fat, lean, tall, short, red heads, brown heads,
homely, handsome, republicans or democrats,
business men or artisans.</p>

<p>The complaining, unpleasant grouch is like a
bear with a toothache. Miserable himself and
spreading misery all around.</p>

<p>A freckle-faced, red-headed, cross-eyed man
with a healthy funny bone will spread more cheerfulness
and sunshine than a bench full of sad and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
solemn justices of the supreme court, or a religious
conference.</p>

<p>What a different story would be written of
Job, if he had only possessed a servant who could
dance a double shuffle and whistle "Dixie" while
cooking breakfast.</p>

<p>David was a man after my own heart; he
brought gladsome songs into the world. He said,
"Live the way of pleasantness."</p>

<p>You can pray, sing, play, work, think, rest,
hope; you can be well or ill, rich or poor and still
be pleasant to live with.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pleasantness
a Tonic
Quality.</div>

<p>Being pleasant helps you to be strong in body
and mind, and it keeps you young a long time.
It's good medicine; I know it. My
little motto, "Be pleasant every
morning until ten o'clock, the rest of
the day will take care of itself," has brought sunshine
into many homes.</p>

<p>If you frown it will soon get to be a habit&mdash;and
give you a heavy heart. If you smile your
face will be attractive, no matter how unlucky
you were in the lottery of beauty.</p>

<p>Be pleasant and you will never feel old. The
pleasant disposition is a sure route to happy land
and happy homes.</p>

<p>Old Ponce de Leon lost out in searching for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
fountain of youth. If he had been pleasant, he
would have kept the smiles on his wife's face and
there would have been no excuse to leave her to
find the mythical fountain.</p>

<p>Hoe cake, bacon and smiles beat lobster, champagne
and frowns.</p>

<p>Our land is thrice blessed with its peaceful,
happy homes&mdash;for "happy homes are the
strength of a nation."</p>

<p>Be pleasant in your home. Make the children
feel home is the pleasantest place in the world.</p>

<p>Every act and example is written in the child's
memory tablet. Let your hours with the children
be loving, laughing, living hours. Pat them on
the head, joke with them, whisper affection, express
love to them. Those acts will be remembered
in all their years to come, for you are planting
everlasting plants that may pass on to a hundred
generations and make children happy a thousand
years from now.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cheerfulness
Its Own
Reward.</div>

<p>Be pleasant to live with and you will have
more pleasant things to live for. There will be
kindnesses, kisses, beauty, health,
peace, fun, happiness and content
coming your way all along the
great big road of life you are traveling.</p>

<p>Be pleasant to live with and the people will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
turn to you as you pass and reflect your cheerfulness
like the sunflowers turn to face the sun.</p>

<p>Be pleasant; don't be cross and crabbed because
someone else in the household is not pleasant.
Do your part; you will likely thereby cure
the frown habit on the face of the unfortunate
disturber of your peace.</p>

<p>Make yourself right before you criticise your
life partner. Answer this question, "Am I pleasant
to live with?"</p>

<p>Don't fool yourself in the matter. Get right
down to brass tacks with yourself, watch your
moves and acts and attitude for ten days carefully
before answering the question.</p>

<p>If your answer is no, now is your time to
change your attitude and try the pleasant plan,
and here is my blessing and good wishes in such
an event.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<h2>5.</h2>


<p>There is fun and interest and diversion all
around us. All we need is keen observation and
we will see much that passes unnoticed to the
preoccupied person.</p>

<p>What an interesting thing is the great round
world we live in! The people are as interesting
as fish in an aquarium.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sitting on
the Side
Lines.</div>

<p>See the rushing, surging crowd. Man pushes
along searching for necessary things to be done;
he builds cities, harnesses rivers,
makes ships to sail the seas to the
uttermost parts of the earth. Man
goes to war, he builds death-dealing devices that
destroy in a few minutes a beautiful cathedral
which has taken centuries to build.</p>

<p>Man makes the desert blossom like a rose.</p>

<p>Here is the scientist in his laboratory, trying
to unite certain elements to produce new substance.
Here is the beauty in her silken nest;
here the lover; there the musician; yonder the
peanut man, and in the office building is the captain
of industry&mdash;all busy bees deeply absorbed
in their respective interests, and intoxicated in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the belief that they are important and greatly
necessary.</p>

<p>Yet in the broad measure of ages they are mere
ripples on the sea of time, faint bubbles on the
eternal deep, and grains of sand at the mountain
foot.</p>

<p>Great man by his own measure&mdash;minute man
by the great measure of time. Mammoths to the
near-sighted&mdash;mites to the far-sighted. Hustle
and bustle, crowd and push. They tramp down
the weaker brothers in the mad race after the
golden shekels, which are only measures of the
ability to buy and own material things; symbols
of power to make others serve you. These golden
shekels which men fret, sweat and fight for, can
only buy physical and material things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Great
Truth.</div>

<p>Away from the crowd is the little group who
have learned a great truth, which is that happiness
is not to be bought with gold.
This little minority knows that mental
pleasures are best, and that mental
pleasures cannot be found on the great highway
of material conquest.</p>

<p>The puffy, corn-fed millionaire pities the man
who is content to live with small means and
enjoy what he has to the full extent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Real
Happiness.</div>

<p>The wise man is he who gets fullness out of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>life&mdash;happiness, respect, content, freedom from
worry; who is busy doing useful
things&mdash;busy helping his brother,
busy training his children, busy
spreading sunshine and love and the close-together
feeling in his home circle.</p>

<p>The corn-fed, hardened, senseless, money-mad,
dollar-worshipper knows not peace. Smiles seldom
linger on his lips. Peace never rests in
his bosom, cheer never lights his face. He is
simply a fighting machine, miserable in solitude,
suffering when inactive and sick when resting.</p>

<p>The money-chaser is up and doing, working
like a Trojan, because occupation takes his mind
off the painful picture of his misspent opportunity
and his destroyed natural instinct. When
fighting for gold he forgets his appalling poverty
in the really worth-while things in the world.</p>

<p>Like the drunkard in his cups, the intoxication
makes him forget, and he is negatively happy.</p>

<p>Money received as reward for doing things
worth-while is laudable.</p>

<p>We cannot sit idly by and neglect to earn
money to provide food, shelter and education for
our loved ones, but between times we should
seek the wealth that comes from right mental
employment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>The millionaire thinks, dreams and gets dollars,
and that is all.</p>

<p>The worth-while man thinks kindness, usefulness,
self-improvement, brotherhood, love and he
gets happiness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doing for
Others.</div>

<p>The man who discovers means to help his
fellow man, does a good act, but is the man
with the dollars in front of his eyes
who commercializes the discovery
and invention. In the end, the man
that helped mankind fares better than the man
who made the millions.</p>

<p>It's a great crowd surging by, and very few
have the good sense to learn the value of TO-DAY.
That great crowd I see below my window
thinks ever of to-morrow and forgets the
wondrous opportunities that to-day holds out.</p>

<p>Those who think always of to-morrow will
never get the beauties and joys from life that
comes to the little group of To-day, who appreciates
and enjoys the real Now, rather than the
pictured To-morrow that never comes.</p>

<p>It's mighty interesting to sit on the side lines
and watch the crowds go by and speculate on
their movements.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Road
to Disillusionment.</div>

<p>Save up your pennies, measure everything by
the dollar standard, think dollars, dream dollars,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>work, slave, push for the dollars
and you will build a fortune. You
will never have peace or recreation
or joy; you will live only in hope of a some day
when you will retire. That's the way the millionaires
travel life's highway.</p>

<p>Some day the paper will announce the death
of those millionaires, and then the dollars will
be blown in by reckless heirs, and so the grinding
wheels roll on.</p>

<p>Surely there are many ways of looking at
things. Surely there is much of interest in the
crowd. Surely there is an unending amount of
thought and speculation possible about that
crowd way down on the street below my window.</p>

<p>What passions, what hopes, what joys, what
sorrows, are in the hearts of that hurrying, worrying
crowd.</p>

<p>What noise this din of traffic makes; what activity
man has stirred up.</p>

<p>A picture, a drama, a tragedy, a comedy&mdash;all
these I see in the human ants that run along below
the hive where I sit and write these lines.</p>

<p>The phone rings and my little Nancy Lou's
voice says, "Daddy, will you please bring me
a pencil and a tablet with lines on it."</p>

<p>So I must needs stop this, whatever you may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
call it, and push through the crowd to get that
tablet with "lines on it" for my Nancy Lou; and
there is some feeling of happiness and content
and peace in Daddy's heart as he lays down his
pen, for Daddy is going Home, and that word
means a lot in his little family, where they all
say "Daddy" instead of Papa or Father.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<h2>6.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Wasted
Energy.</div>

<p>It is hard enough to do duty once, but doubly
hard when you anticipate mentally everything
you have to do to-morrow. This
doing things twice is a habit easily
acquired if you don't watch out,
and it means wasted energy.</p>

<p>I have just read the experience of a housewife
who was resting on a couch and reading. Her eye
caught sight of a book lying on the floor across
the room.</p>

<p>Instantly her mindometer, if I may coin a word,
registered, "When you get up, pick up that
book."</p>

<p>She went on reading, but her mind was not
on the magazine she held, but on that book on
the floor.</p>

<p>So obsessed did she become that she was miserable
until she got up and picked up the book.</p>

<p>I was talking with a woman who was resting
on her porch. Her day's work was over. She
was dressed for the afternoon. Everything in the
home was neat, sweet, clean and tidy. All was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
serene but her face, and that was the window
through which I saw worry working overtime.</p>

<p>By strategy I learned the trouble, and here is
her story: "To-morrow a lot of fruit will be
ready to preserve. I am worrying where I shall
put it. My fruit closet is full."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doing
Things
Twice.</div>

<p>The woman had every reason to say to herself,
"Sufficient unto the day," yet she was doing
the preserving mentally to-day and
to-morrow she would do the work
physically. A tired mind is harder
to rest than a tired body, so we must nip this
advance mental work in the bud.</p>

<p>We have all been mentally obsessed with
worrying about the things we were going to take
on our trip; then worrying over the routine of
our work when we should return from our trip.</p>

<p>If the housewife looks over her week's work
and washes the dishes, makes the beds, cooks the
meals, dresses the children, mends the clothes,
and does all these things in her imagination before
she does them in reality, she is indeed a hard
working woman.</p>

<p>It's all right to plan your work; that's economy
in mental expenditure, for it simplifies, systematizes,
and saves work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Planning is
Efficiency.</div>

<p>Plan your work in advance, but do not keep
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>your mind on the plans until the work is done.
When you have planned, then close
the mental book of to-morrow's
duty, and turn to pleasures, rest,
relaxation and enjoyment of to-day.</p>

<p>It is to get a definite, different thought habit
fixed that I ask you to give me these few minutes
each day, so that we may consider various phases
of life, science, pleasure, morals and mental refreshment.</p>

<p>True, we can only have a fleeting look at things,
but we'll get enough, I hope, to freshen your
minds, change the humdrum, and elicit interest
in things. Maybe these heart-to-heart, confidential
chats will help us and keep us from going
through the mental motions of to-morrow's
physical work.</p>

<p>If these evening talks interest you, help clear
your vision, help cheer you, help rest you, then
they are good for you, and because they help you,
they certainly benefit me and make me very
happy, because happiness comes from doing
something for others.</p>

<p>I write as the mood strikes me, or as a phase
of life comes before me, or as an idea strikes in
and just won't let go until I grasp my pen and
let the words flow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>I mean this book to be human, and not a studied
literary effort.</p>

<p>I want to reach you right there alone in the
room where you are reading this, and I want the
suggestions, the good, the help, to soak in, and
I want you to pass the good you get to your
brother; you won't lose a bit by doing so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<h2>7.</h2>


<p>"She is all right&mdash;her only trouble is her
NERVES." How often we hear that and how
little does the person with steady nerves appreciate
the tortures of "nerves."</p>

<div class="sidenote">About
Nerves.</div>

<p>A cut, a bruise, a headache, or any of the physical
ailments can be quickly cured. Nature will
mend the break, but tired, worn,
stretched, abused nerves take time
to restore. These nerve ailments
call for most vigorous mental treatment.</p>

<p>Neurasthenia means debilitated or prostrated
nerves and it shows itself first of all by worry.
Worry means the inability to relax the attention
from a definite fear or fancied hard luck. Worry
leads to many physical and mental disorders.</p>

<p>Left alone this worry stage develops into an
acute state and brings with it nervous prostration,
and sometimes a complete collapse of the
will power.</p>

<p>Before the acute stage of neurasthenia is
reached, there is noticed "brain fag," and brain
fag is nature's warning signal calling upon you
to take notice and change your mental habits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>Worry sometimes develops into hysteria; again
it takes the form of hypochondria or chronic
blues. The hypochondriac has a chronic, morbid
anxiety about personal health and personal welfare.
Frequently this state is accompanied by
melancholia.</p>

<p>Melancholia is the fork in the road. One turning
leads to incurable insanity, the other to curable
melancholia.</p>

<p>Right here is where heroic action is needed
by the sufferer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cure the
Worry
Habit.</div>

<p>Here is where the sufferer must exert his maximum
will power, and change completely his mental
and physical habits and his surroundings.
Occupation, changed
habits, taking in of confidence, faith
and courage thoughts&mdash;these changes are necessary
to the victim of melancholia, or he will shatter
his health on the danger rocks and go to
pieces.</p>

<p>Melancholia is an ailment that offers a good
chance for Christian Science. Mental suggestion,
the powerful personality of a friend, and the personal
help such a friend can give by counsel,
example and suggestion, are all helps.</p>

<p>I have abundant evidence that melancholia sufferers
can be restored to peace, efficiency and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
poise, by proper thought direction, and by proper
physical employment.</p>

<p>"Pep," which has principally to do with mental
efficiency, definitely lays down rules and practical
suggestions for the employment of the mind
and body. I have letters and verbal proofs in
quantity proving the efficiency of those rules and
suggestions.</p>

<p>So wonderful have been the results, so numerous
the recoveries, that the testimonials, if published,
would make the fake nerve tonic manufacturer
die of envy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Importance
of
Nerves.</div>

<p>"Only your nerves." I cannot understand
why the word, only, is used. It makes it appear
that nerves are of minor importance.
Nerves are less understood
than anything in the human anatomy
and they are harder to understand.</p>

<p>Experience has proved that nerves cannot be
restored by dope, patent medicines, tonics or
prescriptions.</p>

<p>The cure must come by and through the individual
possessing the nerves, and by and through
the individual's power of will and mastery of the
mind.</p>

<p>Get the mental equipment right. Let the mind
master the body. Let the nerve sufferer get hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of himself and fill his brain with faith-thought
instead of fear-thought, with courage instead of
cowardice, with strength instead of weakness,
with hope instead of despair, with smiles instead
of frowns, with occupation instead of sluggishness,
and wonders will appear.</p>

<p>The little shredded, tingling nerve-ends will
then commence to synchronize instead of fight,
to harmonize instead of breaking into discord, to
build instead of destroy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">You Can
"Come
Back."</div>

<p>The building, or coming back to a normal state,
is slow; it takes time, patience and will power,
but it can be done. I know. I
have been through the mill, and I
pass the word to you and try to
stir you to be up and doing, even as I did.</p>

<p>Your nerves can be steadied, your thoughts
uplifted, your health restored, your ambition re-established,
your normality fixed.</p>

<p>Smiles, love and content are to be yours. Poise,
efficiency, peace, your blessings. Health, happiness
and hope your dividends. All these I promise
you if you will read this book from cover to
cover, <i>think</i>, and follow its plain, practical teachings.</p>

<p>The curriculum is not hard; it is not my discovery.
I am merely the purveyor of facts, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
gleaner of truth, and the selector of helpful experiences,
first of all for my own benefit, and
having proved the truth in my own case, for
friends to whom I pass the truths and rules.</p>

<p>I made bold to write books, but the writing has
paid me well, not alone in dollars, but from having
done a helpful thing in writing for other
humans who have had problems, worries and
nerves.</p>

<p>The big books on nerves are discouraging and
forbidding by their immensity and the labyrinth
of technical, scientific terms. There are fine for
teachers, but discouraging for the layman.</p>

<p>The great everyday crowd is the class I want
to talk to, and so I endeavor to write in plain
human, sincere style from heart to heart, with
understanding, feeling, charity and sympathy.</p>

<p>I have felt the things you feel, and if I can
by example, emphasis, suggestion, rule or good
intent, be a help to you, then I have done a
service.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>There are men who cannot be kept down by
circumstances or obstacles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Men
Who Do
Things.</div>

<p>These men "carry on" with confidence in their
hearts and smiles on their faces. They do not
lie in wait for the band wagon or
favorable winds; they make things
happen. They are alert and alive
to every favorable opportunity and helpful influence
that comes their way.</p>

<p>These men are men of good health. They are
out of doors much; they carry their heads high
and breathe in good air deeply. They greet
friends with a smile and put meaning and feeling
into every hand clasp.</p>

<p>Let's you and I follow their trail, for it leads
out on to the big road.</p>

<p>Do not fear being misunderstood; right will
finally come into its own.</p>

<p>We will keep our minds off our enemies, and
keep our thoughts on our purpose; we will make
up our minds what we want to do. We will mark
a straight line on the log and hew to that line.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>Fear is the dope drug that kills initiative; hate
the poison that shatters clear thinking.</p>

<p>Hate and fear are the iron ore in our life's vessel;
they deflect the compass and prevent us from
holding to the course.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grasp
Present
Opportunities.</div>

<p>There are splendid worth-while things for us
to do, and with continuity of action and singleness
of purpose on our part the
days will pass by as we are seizing
opportunity and making use of the
things required for the fulfillment of our desires.
We are like the coral insect that takes from the
running tide the material to build a solid fortress.
Our running tide is made up of the gliding golden
days.</p>

<p>Let's waste no time in trying to make friends
or in seeking to attach ourselves to others. True
friends are not caught by pursuit; they come to
us; they happen through circumstances we do
not create.</p>

<p>Self-reliance is ours, and we must first use it
for our own betterment. We will then have a
surplus of energy to allow us to help others.</p>

<p>Our energy hours must be devoted to our purposes
and ideals. Atween times, we must rest
and relax, and repair the waste that strenuosity
makes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Breathe good air, bask in the sunshine, see
nature, and say to yourself: "All these treasures
are for me; all these things I am part of."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Joy
of Living.</div>

<p>Do not prepare for death; prepare for life. Preparing
for death brings the end before your allotted
time. Like Job of old, that
which we fear will come to us. We
must not think of death, or waste
time preparing for it. It makes us miserable
to-day. It makes us weak and fills us with fear,
and it draws the day of our departure nearer.</p>

<p>To-day is ours. Live freely, fully to-day. Be
unafraid, unhurried, and undisturbed.</p>

<p>We are building character, and the way we
build it is by mental attitude, by our acts, and
by the way we employ the precious moments of
to-day.</p>

<p>Put yourself in harmony with nature&mdash;realize

<div class="sidenote">The
Pessimist.</div>

<p>The calamity howler is found everywhere. In
times of peace or war he is with us. This pessimist
sows seeds of discord, plants
envy, generates the anarchist spirit,
and is an all-around nuisance.</p>

<p>A man may spend years erecting a building;
a fiend can demolish it in a minute with a stick
of dynamite.</p>

<p>The calamity howler is a destroyer; he doesn't
think, he spurts out words. His words and arguments
are simply parrot mimicry and void of
intellectual impulse, as are the movements of
an angle worm.</p>

<p>These gloom merchants talk of their rights,
and they expect and demand the same privileges
and benefits that are earned by the man who
uses his head.</p>

<p>The pessimist sees good in nobody. Human
nature to him is a cesspool of villainy and corruption.
He will not tolerate a word of praise
for a thing well done. Disparagement is his
favorite weapon. He ascribes mean and selfish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
motives to public-spirited men. Every deed of
kindness, every act of generosity, is given a sinister
meaning when seen in the light of his own
base soul.</p>

<p>At home he is a grumbler and a grouch. His
presence depresses, and happiness fades away
at his approach.</p>

<p>In the community, he never reaches high office
because he lacks civic spirit and the forward-looking
view. He obstructs progress instead of
promoting it.</p>

<p>At his work, he lags behind where others
achieve. He rails at conditions instead of changing
them, and eventually he finds himself shelfed
and shunned as a back number.</p>

<p>These purveyors of panic eat into the vitals of
the nation. They breed discontent, undermine
morale, and sow suspicion and distrust where
previously there had been friendliness, co-operation
and the pull-together spirit.</p>

<p>Wherever men gather, you will find these
ghoulish spirits. They are in evidence in times
of peace and plenty, as well as in times of war
and peril.</p>

<p>It matters not that our farmers are seeing to
it that our granaries are filled to-day as never
before, and that every man has a job. These<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
prophets of disaster have only one string to their
harp, and they will twang on that and no other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Danger
of Pessimism.</div>

<p>In times of war, the pessimist is doubly dangerous,
for he spreads his iniquitous propaganda
among people who are already
under a great emotional strain.
Always a menace, when a people
are in the throes of a great life-and-death struggle,
it is doubly necessary to stamp out this destroyer
of morale, with his insidious campaign
of gloom and despair and his veiled innuendos
of panic and destruction.</p>

<p>It is up to you and to me to denounce these
breeders of discord; to hold them up to the scorn
of intelligent, thinking people. They are neither
doers nor thinkers, and the world has no need
of them in these trying times.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<h2>10.</h2>


<p>This evening I rode home in a crowded street
car. What an interesting study it was to watch
the faces in that car.</p>

<p>Discontent, discomfort, worry, gloominess on
nearly every face. Tired faces, tired bodies
drooped over from a hard day's work, mouth corners
depressed. Hopelessness stamped on the
countenances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gloom
and Cheer.</div>

<p>As the people came in the car, some of them
had smiles or at least passable expressions, but
when they got crowded together
and saw the gloomy faces, the
gloom spread to their faces, too.
At a picnic, all are smiling and laughing. In
the street car at six o'clock, the long procession
of workers is a stream of solemn faces. Contagion,
example, surroundings, yes, that's it&mdash;contagion
and example.</p>

<p>At six o'clock in the cars, all is gloom, blueness
and sorrow faces. At eight o'clock many of
these faces will be changed; there will be joy,
smiles, rosiness, singing and dancing. Yet the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
actual conditions of finance, health, hope or prospects
haven't changed since these people were in
the car at six o'clock.</p>

<p>Why, then, such a change in two hours?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Good Cheer
Contagious.</div>

<p>It is this: At seven o'clock these workers sat
down to supper; they were out of that gloom-reflected
street car atmosphere.
Now they are talking; they are
rounding-up the day's activities;
they are HOME with mother, sister, brother and
the kiddies. The home ones greet them with
smiles, the appetizing supper pleases the palate,
good cheer permeates, and all around them is
smiles and joy.</p>

<p>Gloom spreads gloom. Joy spreads joy. Gloom
is black; joy is white. One darkens, the other
brightens.</p>

<p>Well, then, where's the moral? What's the
benefit from this little study of the street car
passengers?</p>

<p>The lesson is plain: It is that you and I are
ferments of joy, or acids of gloom. We are influences
to help or to hurt. To hurt others by
our example hurts us. To help others by our
example helps us. We become happier than ever.</p>

<p>In the street car, life was not worth living if
you judged by the pained faces. In two hours,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
by changed thought, the example of life was
worth while.</p>

<p>What changes mental attitude makes!</p>

His very last cent,<br />
The world looks blue, you bet;<br />

</p>

<p>Next time we get on the street car, let's plant
some smiles. Let's give that lady a seat and
smile when we do it.</p>

<p>We can spread cheer by merely wearing a
cheery face. Costs little, pays big. Let's do it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of our richest blessings are gained by
not striving for them directly. This is so true
that we accept the blessings without thinking
about how we came to get them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Be
Happy.</div>

<p>Particularly true is this in the matter of happiness.
Everyone wants to be happy, but few know
how to secure this blessing. Most
people have the idea that the possession
of material things is necessary
to happiness, and that idea is what keeps
architects, automobile makers, jewelers, tailors,
hotels, railroads, steamships and golf courses
busy.</p>

<p>Do your duty well, have a worth-while ambition,
be a dreamer, have an ideal, keep your duty
in mind, be occupied sincerely with your work,
keep on the road to your ideal, and happiness
will cross your path all the while.</p>

<p>Happiness is an elusive prize; it's wary, timid,
alert and cannot be caught. Chase it and it escapes
your grasp.</p>

<div class="sidenote">One Man's
Story.</div>

<p>I read today of a friend who walked home with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>a workman. This is the workman's story: He
had a son who was making a record
in school. He had two daughters
who helped their mother; he
had a cottage, a little yard, a few flowers, a garden.
He worked hard in a garage by day, and
in the evening he cultivated his flowers, his garden,
and his family. He had health, plus contentment
a-plenty. His possessions were few and
the care of them consequently a negligible effort.</p>

<p>Happiness flowed in the cracks of his door.
Smiles were on his lips, joy in his heart, love
in his bosom; that's the story my friend heard.</p>

<p>Then came a friend in an automobile on his
way home from the club. He picked up my
friend, and unfolded to him a tale of woe, misery
and discontent.</p>

<p>This club man had money, automobiles, social
standing, possessions, and all the objects and material
things envious persons covet&mdash;yet he was
unhappy. His whole life was spent chasing happiness,
but his sixty horsepower auto wasn't fast
enough to catch it.</p>

<p>The poor man I have told you about was the
man who washed the club man's auto.</p>

<p>The strenuous pleasure seeker fails to get happiness;
that is an inexorable law. He develops<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
into a pessimist with an acrid, satirical disgust at
all the simple, wholesome, worth-while, real
things in life.</p>

<p>This is not a new discovery of mine; it's an old
truth. Read Ecclesiastes, the pessimistic chronicle
of the Bible, and you'll learn what comes to
the pleasure-chaser, and you will know about
"vanity and vexation of spirit."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Making
Others
Happy.</div>

<p>Do something for somebody. Engage in moves
and enterprises that will be of service to the community
and help the uplift of mankind.
This making others happy
is a positive insurance and guarantee
of your own happiness.</p>

<p>You must keep a stiff upper lip, a stiff backbone;
you must forget the wishbone and the envious
heart.</p>

<p>Paul had trials, setbacks, hardships and hard
labors; he had defeats and discouragements and
still the record shows he was "always rejoicing."</p>

<p>Paul was a man of Pep. In the dungeon, with
his feet in stocks, he sang songs and rejoiced.
Paul was happy, ever and always, not because he
strove to get happiness, but because he had dedicated
his life to the service of mankind.</p>

<p>The real hero, the real man of fame, the real
man of popularity, doesn't arrive by setting out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
on a quest for any of these things; the result is
incidental.</p>

<p>The real hero forgets self first of all; that is
the essential step to greatness.</p>

<p>Washington at Valley Forge had no thought
that his acts there would furnish inspiration for
a picture that would endure for generations.</p>

<p>Lincoln, the care-worn, tired, noble man, in
his speech at Gettysburg, never dreamed that
that speech would stamp him as a master of
words and thought, in the hearts of his country-men.
He thought not of self. He was trying to
soothe wounds, cheer troubled spirits, and give
courage to those who had been so long in shadowland.</p>

<p>Ever has it been that fame, glory, happiness
came as rewards, not to those who strive to
capture, but to those who strive to free others
from their troubles, burdens and problems.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<h2>12.</h2>


<p>I am often asked: "Are you happy ALL the
time?" My answer is no.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Continuous
Happiness
Impossible.</div>

<p>A continuous state of happiness cannot be enjoyed
by any human. There are no plans, no
habits, no methods of living that
will insure unbroken happiness.
Happiness means periods or marking
posts in our journey along life's road. These
high points of bliss are enjoyed because we have
to walk through the low places between times.</p>

<p>Continuous sunshine, continuous warm weather,
continuous rest, continuous travel, continuous
anything spells monotony. We must have
variety.</p>

<p>We need the night to make us enjoy the day,
winter to make us enjoy summer, clouds to make
us enjoy sunshine, sorrow to make us enjoy happiness.</p>

<p>But, dear reader, mark this: We can be philosophical,
and have content, serenity and poise
between the happiness periods.</p>

<p>When you get blue, or have dread or sorrow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
or possess that indescribable something that
makes you feel badly; when you have worry or
trouble, then's the time to get hold of your thinking
machinery and dispel the shadows that cross
your path.</p>

<p>Occupation and focusing your thoughts on
your blessings&mdash;these are the methods to employ.</p>

<p>As long as you dwell upon your imagined or
your real sorrows, you will be miserable and the
worries will magnify like gathering clouds in
April.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Think
Happiness.</div>

<p>Change your thoughts to confidence, faith, and
good cheer, and busy your hands with work.
Think of the happiness periods you
have had, and know that there are
further happiness dividends coming
to you. Keep this sort of thought, and with
it, useful occupation, and the sunshine will dispel
your gloomy forebodings and sorrow thoughts
like the sun dispels the April showers, bringing
about a more beautiful day because of the clouds
and storms just passed.</p>

<p>When trouble or sorrows come, sweeten your
cup with sugar remembrances of joys that have
been and joys you are to have.</p>

<p>Envy no one; envy breeds worry. The person<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
you would envy has his sorrows and shadows,
too. You see him only when the sunlight is on
the face; you don't see him when he is in shadowland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brace Up,
Cheer Up.</div>

<p>No, dear ones, I, nor you, nor anyone on earth
can have complete, unruffled, continued happiness,
but we can brace up and call
our reserve will-power, reason, and
self-confidence into action when we
come to the marshy places along the road. We
can pick our steps and get through the mire, and
sooner than we believe it possible, we can get on
the good solid ground; and as we travel, happiness
will often come as a reward for our poise
and patience.</p>

<p>My friends say: "You always seem happy,"
and in that saying they tell a truth, for I am
happy often&mdash;very, very often&mdash;and between
times I make myself seem to be happy. This
making myself "seem to be happy" gives me
serenity, contentment, fortitude, and the very
"seeming" soon blossoms into a reality of the
condition I seem to be in.</p>

<p>You can be happy often, and when you are
not happy, just seem to be happy anyway; it will
help you much.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<h2>13.</h2>


<p>A little child is crying over a real or fancied
injury to her body or to her pride.</p>

<p>So long as she keeps her mind on the subject
she is miserable.</p>

<p>Distract her attention, get her mind on another
subject, and her tears stop and smiles replace
frowns.</p>

<p>This shows how we are creatures of our
thoughts. "As a man thinketh in his heart, so
is he" is a truth that has endured through the
centuries.</p>

<p>We are children in so far as we cry and suffer
when we think of our ills or hurts or wrongs or
bad luck.</p>

<p>We can smile and have peace, poise and
strength if we change our thoughts to faith, courage
and confidence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fear-Thought
and Faith-Thought.</div>

<p>Our condition is what we make it. If we think
fear, worry and misery, we will suffer. If we
think faith, peace and happiness,
we will enjoy life. Every thought
that comes out of our brain had to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
go in first. The kind of thoughts we have afford
an indication of the kind of people we are.</p>

<p>If we feed our brain storehouse with trash and
fear and nonsense, we have poor material to
draw from.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thought
Control.</div>

<p>The last thought we put in the brain before
going to sleep is most likely to last longest. So
it is our duty to quietly relax, to
slow down, to eliminate fear-thought
and self-accusation, and to
substitute some good helpful thought in closing
the mental book of each day.</p>

<p>Therefore read a chapter or two from a worth-while
book the last thing before going to bed.</p>

<p>Say to yourself, "I am unafraid; I can, I will
awake in the morning with smiles on my face,
courage in my heart, and song on my lips."</p>

<p>These suggestions for closing the day will be
of instant help to you.</p>

<p>The great power for good&mdash;the wherewith to
give you strength, progress and efficiency&mdash;is
within yourself and at the command of your will.</p>

<p>You can't think faith and fear, good and bad,
courage and defeat, all at the same time.</p>

<p>You can only think one thing at a time.</p>

<p>Your great power is your will, and the wherewith
to help yourself is your thought habit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Change your thought habit as you go to bed.
You can do it; it's a matter of will determination.
The more faithful you are to your purpose,
the easier your task will be. Be patient, conscientious,
rational and confident.</p>

<p>You are what your thoughts picture you to
be. Your will directs your thoughts.</p>

<p>Don't get discouraged if you can't suddenly
change your life from shadow to sunshine, from
illness to wellness.</p>

<p>Big things take time and patience. The great
ship lies in the harbor pointed North. A tug boat
could make a sudden pull and break the great
chain or tow line.</p>

<p>Yet you could take a half-inch rope and with
your own hands turn the great ship completely
around by pulling steadily and patiently. The
movement would be slow, but it would be sure
and you would finally accomplish your purpose.</p>

<p>Don't jerk and fret and be impatient with yourself.
You have been for years perhaps worrying
and thinking fear-thoughts. You have put a lot
of useless and harmful material in your brain.</p>

<p>You can't clean all your brain house in a day
or a week, but you can do a little cleaning each
day.</p>

<p>You can take the faith-rope of good purpose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
and start to pull gently, and finally you will turn
your whole life's character toward the port of
success.</p>

<p>The great crowd worries; only the few have
learned the power of the will, and the benefits to
be derived from mental control.</p>

<p>Business and social duties call for strong men
and woman. You can't reach mastership if you
remain a slave.</p>

<p>Your first duty is to yourself, and success or
failure is your reward exactly in proportion as
you exercise your will power and handle your
thought habits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Best
Medicine.</div>

<p>The doctors are giving less medicine and doing
more in the way of suggesting diet and exercise
rules, sanitation and preventive
practices. Medicine is mostly poison
and its effect is to shock the
organs or glands to bring about reaction. Nature
makes the cure.</p>

<p>In emergency drugs are all right, but the doctor
and not the individual should settle the matter
of what drug to use and the proper time to
use it.</p>

<p>When there's a pain or disease, it's due to congestion
of some organ, to infection, or to improper
nourishment, or improper habits.</p>

<p>Ninety per cent of aches, pains and ailments
can be cured by a dominant mental attitude and
by proper attention to eating and exercise.</p>

<p>The habitual medicine user is not cured by
the medicine but by nature; the medicine simply
serves as a means to establish mental control and
to create confidence in the sufferer that he is to
get well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>Recently I spent much time in a large hospital
visiting a relative who had been operated on. I
know several members of the staff of doctors and
nurses.</p>

<p>I have seen many operations, some very heroic
ones, and my appreciation of the good work of
good surgeons is greatly augmented by the wonderful
helps I have seen them bring to suffering
humanity.</p>

<p>I have talked with scores of patients and
watched the progress of their cases.</p>

<p>I have by plausible logic, mental suggestion,
and good cheer to the hospital patients, brought
many a smile through a mist of tears.</p>

<p>I have seen the wonderful results of mental
suggestion to the discouraged patients.</p>

<p>To show the effects that faith-thought will
produce, I will relate some instances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mental
Sickness.</div>

<p>One patient screaming for a hypodermic injection
to relieve her pain was given an injection
of sterilized water and the pain vanished.
Another just could not sleep
without her bromide. The nurse
fixed up a powder of sugar, salt and flour;
the patient took the powder and went to
sleep. That was mind control and mental
longing satisfied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>Another patient had to take something to stop
her pains; she got capsules of magnesia. The
capsule satisfied her longing, established her faith
and gave her relief; the relief was through her
mind and not through the capsule.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Changing
Thought
Direction.</div>

<p>I have seen several weary, despondent patients
fretting and wearing themselves out over their
so-called weakness and run-down
condition. I have placed copies of
"Pep" in their hands and watched
courage, faith, cheer and serenity come to them.
It diverted their minds from self-thought and
self-accusation to faith-thought, confidence and
courage.</p>

<p>You can think of only one thing at a time, and
"Pep" or any other book that can change the
thought habit from fear to faith, from worry to
peace, is doing a service.</p>

<p>I've been in shadowland in the hospital to see
for myself the actual help that mental control
will bring to sufferers, and the evidence is far
above my powers to describe.</p>

<p>I've seen the patient's eyes brighten up when
the cheery surgeon came with hope, smiles and
confidence on his face.</p>

<p>I've seen the drooping of spirits when well-meaning
but poor-expressing friends came into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the patient's room and condoned and sorrowed
with him.</p>

<p>Verily, "as a man thinketh in his heart, so is
he."</p>

<p>Verily, good cheer and good thought are good
medicines.</p>

<p>And to these truths all good doctors say
"Amen!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 100%;" />
<h2>15.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">The Pill
Fiend.</div>

<p>How often we see the pill fiend. In his vest
pocket he has a small apothecary shop&mdash;a collection
of round paste-board boxes
and little bottles. Every little while
he dopes himself. If his stomach
is on a strike, he pops in a pill. If his head aches,
he takes a tablet. If he sneezes, he takes a cold-cure
pill.</p>

<p>When anyone around speaks of a pain or ache,
he hands the person a pill.</p>

<p>The pill eater is a hypochondriac, and very
likely his doctor knows it. His salvation is that
the doctor probably gives him harmless stuff in
pill form. The patient doesn't know this, and
it's like a rabbit's foot or a piece of pork rubbed
on a wart&mdash;it satisfies the mind and nature
makes the cure.</p>

<p>Often, however, the pills are not innocent; the
pill fiend buys the tablets and pills direct from
the druggist. The headache tablet is most likely
one of the coal tar drugs like acetanilid, and that
is positively harmful when taken too often.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>There are times to take pills&mdash;in cases of
emergency, when you can shock nature with a
poison and bring a wholesome reaction.</p>

<p>These times are rare, and the doctor should
be the sole judge as to when such treatment is
necessary.</p>

<p>Exercise, diet, correct habits of living will prevent
the congestion and clogging-up that causes
illness and pain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Dangerous
Habit.</div>

<p>The pill habit is nothing less than a drug habit,
and the drug habit positively weakens the system.
The headache tablet does not
cure the headache; it only stops the
pain; the evil is still there. The
headache is merely nature's signal that something
is out of whack.</p>

<p>Headaches are generally caused by stomach
disorders, eye strain, or neuralgia; the latter in
turn is caused by too much uric acid in the system.</p>

<p>Eat fruit, drink plenty of water, and that will
flush the system and stop stomachic headache.</p>

<p>See the optician if it's eyes. If you have a frequent
headache in the forehead, very likely it's
the eyes, even though you do not suspect it.</p>

<p>If it's neuralgia, get a corrective diet from the
doctor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>I know scores of men, and women, too, who
take pills enough to kill a person. Their systems
have been educated up to it; they are saturated
with poison.</p>

<p>And the worst of it is they never get well while
taking the pills; it is only a temporary deadening
of the pain.</p>

<p>Then, there are many who take pills to make
them sleep. That's a crime. It's self-murder by
slow degrees, for they are surely shortening their
lives by this poison dope pill habit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nature,
the Curer.</div>

<p>Mark this: Nature, and Nature alone, effects
cures, and it's in very, very few instances that
a poison pill can be used to advantage.
You can keep well by
getting good air, good water, good
sunshine, good food, good exercise, good rest,
good cheer and good thought. That is what I
call my golden prescription, and it will do wonders
for you, and every doctor will tell you so.</p>

<p>Pills kill, if you keep up the habit. There are
no two ways about it. I say positively and
knowingly that this pill habit is absolutely life
shortening.</p>

<p>Don't try to argue; the evidence is unshakable
on this point.</p>

<p>If you could have seen the derelicts in the hos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>pitals
that I have, if you could have seen the
wretched bodies, destroyed nerve systems, the
broken-down, emaciated, hopeless shells of men
and women addicted to the baneful pill habit,
you would be as positive as I am that pills kill
if you keep up the habit.</p>

<p>Life is sweet and precious to us all. Do not
shorten it by taking pills and tablets for every
ache or pain. Try nature's way. Realize that
mental suggestion and will-power will drive away
most pains or temporary aches.</p>

<p>Brace up, cheer up; chuck the pills in the garbage
can.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<h2>16.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Two Kinds
of Pleasures.</div>

<p>There are two principal kinds of pleasures that
man seeks; one is material pleasures, and about
ninety-nine per cent of the human
family devote themselves to these.
The remainder&mdash;the one per cent&mdash;seek
mental pleasures, and this little group is
the one that gets the real, lasting, satisfying and
improving pleasures out of life.</p>

<p>The material pleasures are the social pleasures
of eating, displaying, possessing, and so forth.
Material pleasures generate in the human the desire
for fluff, feathers, and four-flushing.</p>

<p>Material pleasures accentuate the desire to possess
things, and in the strife for possession, hearts
are broken, fortunes wasted, nerves shattered,
and the finer sentiments calloused.</p>

<p>The homes where material pleasures abound
are the ones where worry, neurasthenia and nervous
prostration abound.</p>

<p>Material pleasures are merely stimulants for
the time being, and there always come the intermittent
reflexes of gloom and depression.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>The desire to show off, to excite envy in others,
is always present at the homes where material
pleasures are the rule.</p>

<p>Material pleasures call for crowds. Mental
pleasures are best enjoyed in solitude.</p>

<p>The material pleasure-seeker lives a life of convention,
engagements, routine, strain, and high
tension.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mental
Pleasures
Are Best.</div>

<p>The person who is so fortunate as to appreciate
and follow mental pleasures is serene, natural,
happy and content. A cozy room,
loved ones around, music, books,
love and social conversation&mdash;those
are mental pleasures; those are best. He
who can pick up a book and read things worth
while, gets satisfaction unknown to those whose
life is a round of banquets, theaters, dances, automobiles,
parties, bridge, clubs and society doings.</p>

<p>When you spend the evening playing cards,
the chances are you come home late, and when
you retire, it takes perhaps an hour or so before
you fall to sleep.</p>

<p>And during the night you dream of cards, of
certain hands, of certain circumstances, or certain
persons who were prominent in the evening's
game.</p>

<p>The reason you do not go to sleep after an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
exciting evening is that you have set your nerve
carburetor at high tension and have forgotten to
lower it before you go to sleep.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Good
Reading.</div>

<p>On the other hand, when you have been reading
a restful book, full of good thought, you establish
an equilibrium, a relaxed
state of nerves, and particularly,
you have switched the current or
direction of your day's thoughts. That change
spells rest, and you retire and go to sleep easily.</p>

<p>You will scarcely believe what a wondrous
change for the better you will notice in yourself
if you make it a rule to have a brain clearing,
mental inventory, and nerve relaxation every
night before you go to sleep.</p>

<p>Your brain works at night always; oft-times
you have no remembrance of your dreams, but
if your last hour, before retiring, was an hour
of excitement, tension or unusual occupation, you
will likely go over it all again in your dreams.</p>

<p>If you will let nothing prevent your evening
period of soliloquy, you will establish your mental
habits into a rhythm that will give you peace,
rest and benefit.</p>

<p>In the olden days, when most families had
evening worship or family prayers, the members
of those households slept soundly and restfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>Particularly was this so because of the habit
formed of getting the mind on peaceful, helpful,
comforting, soul-satisfying thoughts that remained
fresh on the brain tablets as the members
of the home circle went to sleep.</p>

<p>Too often the books read in the home circle
are all of the exciting, fascinating, highly colored
imaginative type. People read stories of love,
adventure or crime, and they dream these same
things almost every night.</p>

<p>I have found that it pays to read two classes
of literature in the same evening. First read
your novel, story, or fascinating book, but fifteen
minutes before you are ready to go to sleep,
read some good, wholesome, helpful, uplifting
book, and that good stuff will be lastingly filed
away in your brain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What to
Read.</div>

<p>Finish your evening with books that are interesting,
yet educational. Such books as "Life of
the Bee" by Maeterlinck, or any
one of Fabre's wonderful books on
insect life; "Riddle of the Universe"
by Haeckel; Darwin's books; Drummond's
"Ascent of Man;" "Walks and Talks in
Geological Fields" is a splendid mental night
cap; "Power of Silence;" "Physiology of Faith
and Fear;" Emerson's "Essays;" Holmes'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
"Autocrat of the Breakfast Table;" "Rubaiyat"
of Omar Khayyam; Tom Moore's Poems; "Plutarch's
lives;" Seneca; Addison; Bulwer Lytton;
Hugo; Carlyle's "Sartor Resartus." This latter
book will not fascinate you like Carlyle's "French
Revolution," but you will learn to love its fine
language, its fine analysis of character, of times,
and of things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What You
Gain.</div>

<p>There are countless books of the good improving
kind. Always save one of them for your solid
reading, after you have read light literature
or novels. If you will get

<p>The lover of books and home can enjoy the

<div class="sidenote">Verbomania.</div>

<p>The malady Verbomania is spreading rapidly.
What's that? You have never heard of Verbomania?
Well, then, it's taken from
<i>verbosus</i>, the Latin word meaning
"abounding in words," the using of more words
than is necessary. <i>Mania</i>, also Latin, means "to
rage"&mdash;excessive or unreasonable desire. Therefore,
Verbomania is the excessive desire to use
more words than are necessary.</p>

<p>There is too much talk nowadays and too little
thinking. Some persons start their gab carburetors,
and they talk and talk mechanically, without
any effort spent in thinking. Just like walking,
the motion just goes by itself.</p>

<p>Scientists have suggested that perhaps too
much talking without thinking is a disease. I
don't see that there is any <i>perhaps</i> about it. Disease
is an unnatural condition&mdash;a function of the
mind or body out of its natural order of working.</p>

<p>We know we can sit down and run ideas
through our brain without words, and we can
use a lot of words without ideas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>You have read whole pages in a book without
receiving an idea. One can rattle off words and
not have ideas. When the fountain of words
flows in a desert of ideas, it's Verbomania.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Think More,
Talk Less.</div>

<p>People in all walks of life have the disease;
they talk together too much without any reason
other than to take up time or make
themselves at ease. Pink teas, receptions
and society functions are
great rookeries for these Verbomania birds to
gather and indulge in their gabfest.</p>

<p>The pianist through long practice is able to
play a difficult composition without thinking
about it; it's automatic; it's habit in action.</p>

<p>The society dodo bird is just as dexterous in
spinning words without thought, as the pianist
with his difficult piece.</p>

<p>Our rapid mode of living, our conventions and
customs are responsible for much of the Verbomania.</p>

<p>I should like to take my Dictophone to a fussy
"afternoon" and record the word evacuations,
the footless conversation, the forced pleasantries,
the set sentences that mingle into a hum and
buzz. A wilderness of words in a barrenness of
ideas.</p>

<p>This abuse of the use of speech makes head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>aches,
weariness, worry, unrest; it saps strength,
lowers pep, and lessens resistance.</p>

<p>The cure for Verbomania is to keep away from
these butterfly buzz bees; put the clothes-pin of
caution on your lips; spend more time alone
with your thoughts. Nourish your idea plants
that have been starved; prune your word plants.</p>

<p>Don't expose yourself to the crowds where the
Verbomaniacs gather. The disease is contagious;
it's easy to acquire and hard to retire.</p>

<p>These are ideas put in type to convey a truth
for the benefit of all who read these lines, and
it is some truth, too.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Love builds homes, gold builds houses. The
home has a mongrel dog which is called Prince,
and all the family love it. The house had a pedigreed
bull pup that is kept in the barn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">House and
Home.</div>

<p>There is all the difference between the family
which has a home and the family which has a
house. In houses we find broken
hearts, worry, nervous prostration,
because there is idleness, artificiality
and aimlessness. In homes we find warm
hearts, happiness and love, because those in the
home have natural, helpful occupation.</p>

<p>In the house is cold reserve; the occupants read
when compelled to stay indoors; they grow
crabbed and cross and get into a state of habitual
dumbness and selfishness.</p>

<p>In the home there is unselfishness, thoughtfulness,
and love expressed. Meal time is joy time;
it's the get-together period of smiling faces.</p>

<p>In the house the breakfast table is merely a
lunch station in the hurried trip from the bedroom
to the office.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>The sensitive wife of the house gets stinging
remarks that abide with her after the lord and
master of the house has departed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Makes
Home.</div>

<p>In the home the family gets up plenty early
enough. Songs and jokes, kisses and love pats
are found; the family is on time,
and there is happiness all around.
Homes are sweet, because love is
present. Houses built by gold are just hotels.</p>

<p>I've noticed the difference when a friend invites
me to come to his home or to his house;
the word he uses, home or house, indicates to
me what I will find when I go there.</p>

<p>In the house I meet a maid or butler at the
door. I see conventional furniture, conventional
rooms. I am shown into a conventional waiting
room, and I wait conventionally for the hostess to
come forward with a stiff backbone, a forced
smile, and a languid handshake.</p>

<p>When I go to a home built with love, I find a
tidy dressed wife at the door, rosy children, and
I get a warm, old-fashioned hand clasp, and a
beaming, smiling face that spells welcome.</p>

<p>And the dinner&mdash;that, too, tells the difference
between the "depend-on-the-cook" establishment
and the "wife-who-is-the-boss" home.</p>

<p>At the house is formality and frigidity; at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
home is ease and enjoyment. The children of
the home make breaks and we love them for
it; it's natural instinct and frankness.</p>

<p>In the house is worry; in the home is happiness.</p>

<p>Verily, there's a difference in the atmosphere
of the house built with gold and the home built
with love; one is worthless existence, the other
worth-while living.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Seven Simple
Health
Suggestions.</div>

<p>I haven't space in this book to give reasons or
show proofs for everything I suggest, but I want
right here to give you a few definite,
short, positive, helpful rules
about food, thought, habit and exercise
that will pay you the most wonderful dividends
in health and happiness.</p>

<p>First&mdash;Drink two or three glasses of warm,
not hot, water, the first thing when you arise in
the morning.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;Repeat this resolve as you are drinking
the water: "I will be pleasant this morning
until ten o'clock, and the rest of the day will take
care of itself."</p>

<p>Third&mdash;Walk to your office or place of business,
unless it is over four miles, in which case
walk the first three miles and ride the remainder
of the distance.</p>

<p>Fourth&mdash;Eat one or two apples every day, and
do not insult Nature's proper adjustment by peeling
the apple. You want the skin because it has
things in it you need for your body, and especially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
for your brain, and you have especial need of the
roughage the skin gives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Get Enough
Sleep.</div>

<p>Fifth&mdash;Spend eight or nine hours a day in bed.
I belong to the sixty-three hour club; that means
nine hours a day rest, seven days
in a week, which is sixty-three
hours. If, through business, travel
or other circumstances, I stay up late one or two
nights a week, I balance books before the week
is up by taking a rest on Sunday afternoon or
going to bed earlier one or two nights.</p>

<p>Sixth&mdash;Don't stay in bed Sunday morning. It
will make you tired, loggy, stupid and cross. Get
up Sunday, say, a half hour or an hour later than
week days. Later in the day take a nap if you
wish.</p>

<p>Seventh&mdash;Spend fifteen minutes just before going
to bed in quiet, relaxed solitude. This is the
time to slow down your tension, relax your muscles
and soothe your nerves.</p>

<p>These rules you can easily remember and if
you follow them as I hope you will, the red blood
will course in your veins and joy will be in your
countenance and the halo of happiness will be
around your face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 100%;" />
<h2>20.</h2>


<p>Every once in a while the human has a negative
day. Every act, thought, or spoken sentence
has a but, a don't, a can't, or some other
negative attachment to it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Negative
Attitude.</div>

<p>The children laugh, play and cut up in the
morning, and mother says: "I don't know what
I shall do with you, you are just
wearing me out."  This puts a fear-thought
and a weakness-germ both
in mother and the kiddies.</p>

<p>On Sunday afternoon the family is resting.
Mother maybe gets the blues, and says: "What's
the use, I never get anywhere, go any place; it's
just grind, work and worry all the time."</p>

<p>Mother worries because there's a leak in the
roof and the water stained the paper in the
spare room. She worries because she lives in a
rented house, and says: "I have no heart to fix
things up because this is a rented house."</p>

<p>This negative thought brings on a misery state;
it's worry, and the worry comes because you
dwell on the off side of things. You rehearse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
your problem, you go over your work, you count
your obstacles, and you pile up the negative and
fear thoughts.</p>

<p>Bless you, my dear sister, I know what this
negative can't, don't, but, and what's-the-use
thought is and how it brings misery. I know
how the children get on your nerves and make
you say "don't" all day to them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Show Your
Positive Side.</div>

<p>There's only one way to drive out this negative
thought and that is to switch your will power
to the positive current. Next time
you have a negative day and the fear
thoughts come, just start in one by
one and count your blessings of health, blessings
of home, and blessings of love.</p>

<p>Nothing can hurt you. You've been through
these negative days time and time again; the
clouds gathered, you were blue, lonesome, homesick
and heartsick, but next day you got busy
with work, and occupation drove away the clouds,
and the sunshine came. The next Sunday you
get in this negative state, just put on your hat
and go out to see some neighbor, or go to the
park, or take a walk.</p>

<p>Don't sit and stew and fret over your magnified
troubles.</p>

<p>Let the children play and laugh; they are not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
hurting anyone. God bless them. They don't
have worries; their little lives are all too short.
Their example of smiles and laughter should
make you happy. Soon, too soon, they will grow
up and go their ways in life and how precious
will be the memories of their carefree, golden,
happy childhood days.</p>

<p>Cut out envy; that's a mighty bad negative
wire. It's the devil's favorite food to make worry
and discontent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Envy Makes
Worry.</div>

<p>Many of the people you envied in the past
are dead and buried. Many of the people you
envy now are at heart miserable, and
you wouldn't envy them if you could
look through the artificial outside and
know their real hidden thoughts and lives.</p>

<p>"What's-the-use"&mdash;that's a bad thing to say;
it plants worry seed.</p>

<p>You are all right; you have far more blessings
than sorrows. You can never be entirely free
from troubles, care or little irritations.</p>

<p>Rise superior to these things; those around you
are affected by and susceptible to your influence
and example.</p>

<p>If you have a "but," an "if" or a "don't" tied
to every command to your children, they will
recognize your uncertainty and your negative,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
hurtful attitude, and they will take your threats,
as well as your promises, with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Be careful in giving commands; don't put a
Spanish bit in the children's mouths to jerk them
and torture them.</p>

<p>Be positive, make your promises and orders
stick, and the kiddies will soon know you mean
what you say.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exposing
Your
Weakness.</div>

<p>These negative "driving me crazy" attachments
to your commands spell weakness, and
make you drive, cajole and spin out
your orders, and the children hesitate
and are slow to obey. Let them see
your positive side. Let them learn to obey with
a "yes, mamma" spirit, and your orders will be
less frequent, shorter, and they will be obeyed
on the instant.</p>

<p>The kiddies learn to size you up, mamma, and
if they see a wobbly, worried, despondent, unsure
attitude in you, they will discount your threats
and make allowances, saying: "That's mamma's
way."</p>

<p>Don't show your cry side but show your smile
side.</p>

<p>Sunday is a great trial day for you, mamma,
but don't let your negative wires get the best
of you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>Sing as you make the beds and tidy up; let
sunshine in and drive out the gloom.</p>

<p>Blue Sundays are horror days for the children;
you can't expect them to sit still like older folks.
They are full of red blood and active muscles.</p>

<p>Don't make Sunday a day of punishment to
your children. They get their cue from you.
Don't you be negative and cross and gloomy.
It's bad business for you and all the family.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<h2>21.</h2>


<p>The benefits of walking are so quickly apparent
that I hope to get you to make the start and
keep it up for two weeks. Then you will require
no further urging.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Best
Exercise.</div>

<p>In walking, there are two most important
things to do in order to get the greatest benefits:
first&mdash;walk alone; second&mdash;walk
your natural gait. So many people
tell me they would like to walk all,
or part of the way, between their home and office
if they had company.</p>

<p>Company is the very thing you don't want in
walking, and there are two reasons for this. One
is, if you walk with a friend, you will hold yourself
back, or else you will be walking faster than
your natural gait. In either case it is a conscious
effort, and this conscious effort, to a large degree,
will cause you to lose much of the benefit from
your walk.</p>

<p>The most important reason, however, is that
if you walk with a friend, you are sure to talk,
and thus you are using your nervous energy and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
tiring your brain&mdash;the very thing you want to
avoid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Walk,
Not Talk.</div>

<p>Walking gives you physical exercise which is
absolutely necessary for health. It is the best
exercise I know of, because you do
not overdo your strength. Walking
is beneficial, because when you walk
alone, you give your brain a rest. You cannot
read the papers, you cannot talk, and your mental
apparatus gets complete rest.</p>

<p>I recommend that you walk anywhere from
three to four miles in the morning. If your home
is more than four miles from the office, walk
three or four miles of the distance and then take
the car.</p>

<p>Do not walk home in the evening unless the
walk is a short one. In the evening you are
tired, and you should conserve your strength.
In the morning you are fresh, and the exercise
comes to you at a time it is most needed. It will
give you strength and courage, and help to keep
you in a good mood all day.</p>

<p>I cannot too strongly emphasize the importance
of walking alone, for it is then that you
shift your nerve energy from the dry cell battery
of the brain to the magneto, which is the spinal
cord. The spinal cord works automatically and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
it doesn't wear itself out. The brain tires if it
uses its energy.</p>

<p>In walking you use the thought and the brain
impulse to start the magneto, and then the spinal
cord action is automatic.</p>

<p>This automatic action of the spinal cord is a
wise provision of nature to conserve strength.</p>

<p>The spinal cord energy is what you might call
automatic habit.</p>

<p>For instance, in dressing and undressing yourself,
you will recall that you put on or take off
your clothes in regular order without giving the
matter any thought. It is just habit.</p>

<p>If you wish to demonstrate the difference between
the control of the physical body by brain
impulse, and the spinal cord impulse, try this
some morning: Start out for your exercise and
mentally frame sentences like this as you walk&mdash;"right
step, left step, right step, left step," and
so on. Give thought to each step you have taken,
and notice how tired you will be when you have
gone half a mile.</p>

<p>The next morning, start to walk naturally; give
no thought to walking; keep your mind on the
beauties of nature which you are passing, or
indulge in pleasant soliloquy, and you will feel
no fatigue.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>There isn't a bit of theory in this chapter; it is
positive, practical sense that I have proved by
my own experiences and by the experiences of
everyone to whom I have made this suggestion
of walking alone.</p>

<p>The moral is this&mdash;walk every morning and
walk ALONE.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 100%;" />
<h2>22.</h2>


<p>The body is made up of billions of little cells.
These individual cells are in a state of perpetual
activity. They exhaust, wear away, break down
with work, and rebuild on food and rest. Every
process of life&mdash;the beat of the heart, the throb
of the brain in thought, the digestion of food, the
excretion of waste&mdash;all are due to the activity
of groups of highly specialized individual cells.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Body
Waste.</div>

<p>Every cell uses up its own material and throws
off poisonous by-products during activity. These
by-products, or wastes, are very poisonous
to the individual cell as well
as to the entire organism. To get
rid of this waste is one of the first duties of the
system.</p>

<p>It is with the body, made up of its countless
millions of individual cells, just as it is with a city
and its myriad people: the sewage of the community
must be collected and disposed of. The
city forms its poisons which we call sewage and
the body its poisons, which we call excreta (or
carbonic acid, urea, uric acid, faeces, etc.). It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
is no more important for a city to gather up and
get ride of its poisonous sewage than for the animal
organism to collect and excrete its cell-waste.
Hence, the importance of maintaining normal and
constant elimination throughout the body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Health's
Safety-First.</div>

<p>Elimination is kept up by the alimentary tract,
the kidneys, the skin, and the lungs. These four
are the great pipe-line sewerage systems,
so to speak, by which the body
throws off its gaseous, liquid and
solid poisons.</p>

<p>The lungs momentarily strain carbonic acid
out of the blood and throw it out in the expired
air. They likewise exhale other noxious matters
from the system.</p>

<p>The alimentary tract throws off faeces, made
up of the waste tissue from the whole system,
especially the digestive organs, as well as indigestible
and non-nutritious portions of the food.</p>

<p>The kidneys strain out urea, uric acid, and certain
other poisons from the blood and eject them
through the urinary tract.</p>

<p>Finally the skin likewise is an excretory organ
and exhales a very definite amount of gaseous and
fluid waste in the course of each twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>The skin throws off all the way from a pint to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
two quarts of liquid each day in the form of vapor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proper
Functioning.</div>

<p>Thus, to carry on normal elimination from the
body, the breathing, digesting, urinary and cutaneous
systems must be kept working
normally. To impair the work of any
of these is to retard bodily drainage.
To make certain that elimination is going on naturally,
it is necessary to secure perfect functioning
of lungs, bowels, kidneys and the skin.</p>

<p>Any stoppage in the process of elimination
means that some fault has crept into the work of
one of these excretory systems. It must be plain
now why a disorder of any one of these organs
of elimination means so much more profound disturbance
to the whole organization than merely
disease in one structure. It means that waste
products are retained which ought to be thrown
out of the body; so straightway every cell in the
body begins to be more or less affected. Some
poisons disturb one organ more and some another,
but in the end the whole body must inevitably
be affected.</p>

<p>Lack of exercise, bolting of food, eating soft,
starchy things, failure to chew properly, failure
to get enough roughage, insufficient water, insufficient
fruit&mdash;these are the general causes of
stoppage in the elimination processes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>Drink one or two glasses of warm water, not
hot, the first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>Eat one or two apples, skins and all, every day.
Eat toast, especially the crust. Eat cracked
wheat or whole wheat bread often.</p>

<p>Exercise plenty. Keep cheerful. Eat regularly.</p>

<p>Very likely you eat too much. You don't need
three big meals a day unless you work outdoors
at hard physical labor.</p>

<p>Your body is an engine. No use to keep the
boiler red hot and two hundred pounds of steam
on if your work is light.</p>

<p>Good health depends upon proper assimilation
and elimination as nature intended.</p>

<p>Eat less, exercise more, you who work indoors.
If you don't use this caution, you are just slowly
killing yourself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<h2>23.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Never Say
"Can't."</div>

<p>Many have the habit of keeping their minds
on their weaknesses or their shortcomings. If
they read of some one doing a great
thing or making a worth-while accomplishment,
they say: "I never
could do such a thing."</p>

<p>These persons are always saying, "I never have
luck. I can't do this. I can't do that."</p>

<p>Always knocking, always thinking "can't" instead
of "can" makes for fear, irresoluteness,
uncertainty and weakness of character.</p>

<p>To say, "I can't, I haven't the ability, I am
unlucky" makes you weak and knocks out all
chance for doing things.</p>

<p>Nothing comes out of the brain that wasn't
burned in by thought. If you disparage yourself,
belittle your capacity, or drown your good
impulses with doubt and self-accusation, you are
putting away a lot of bad thought in your brain,
and no wonder you will lack in initiative, ambition,
confidence and courage.</p>

<p>To those who claim to be unlucky, I want to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
say you are not unlucky&mdash;you simply lack pluck.</p>

<p>You start at undertakings with a handicap of
fear. You have made up your mind that you
can't accomplish. You are half beaten before the
game starts. In place of the will to achieve, you
approach your task in fear and trepidation. In
place of confidence and courage and high aspirations,
you set out on your journey with the millstone
of doubt and irresolution around your neck.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confidence
and Success.</div>

<p>There is but one way to succeed. That is to
cast fear and self-accusation aside, and throw
your full weight into the struggle
with a song on your lips and confidence
in your heart.  "Victory"
should be your battlecry and "Confidence"
should be emblazoned on your shield.</p>

<p>Many a man has been whipped in a fight, defeated
in a contest, or beaten at an undertaking,
but he didn't show it or let the other fellow know
it. He just kept on with a brave front, and finally
the other fellow quit, mistaking grim determination,
pluck and perseverance for strength and victory.</p>

<p>Ethan Allen with his handful of men were
asked to surrender by the British general with
his superior force. By all the rights and rules
of war, Ethan was licked, but he didn't give in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
He replied: "Surrender h&mdash;ll; I've just commenced
to fight." If Ethan had accused himself
and said, "I can't whip that big bunch; there's
no hope," he would have been whipped to a finish.</p>

<p>Don't show the enemy or the world your weakness.
Don't admit anything impossible that is
capable of accomplishment.</p>

<p>It's the "I can" man who wins. No man ever
won a fight if he started out by saying, "I can't
whip him, he is too much for me; I am no match
for him, but I'll try."</p>

<p>No person ever made success in business if he
started in with uncertainty, lack of confidence
and unbelief in his ability. Confidence has ever
been half the battle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The World's
Judgment.</div>

<p>Knock yourself, and the world will accept you
at your own estimate. Show streaks of yellow
cowardice, and the mob will pounce
on you like a pack of hungry wolves.
Accuse yourself, curse your luck, belittle
your worth, be afraid, and you will remain
a mere bump on a log, unnoticed, uninteresting,
uninvited.</p>

<p>The world welcomes men who do things. The
world judges by outward appearances. If your
heart is sick, if your courage is low, don't show
it. Put up a stiff attitude and act with confi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>dence,
and that attitude will carry you over many
a pitfall and past many an obstacle.</p>

<p>Show strength and the world will help you;
show weakness and the world will shun you.</p>

<p>You are prejudiced when it comes to judging
yourself. You compare your weakness with your
friends' strength, and this comparison is unfair;
it makes you lose confidence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doubt and
Belief.</div>

<p>Nothing hurts one worse than doubting one's
own ability, assets, and character. When you
find yourself experiencing doubt, or
inability, or hard luck, turn square
around and say: "Begone, doubt;
henceforth I have belief."</p>

<p>Say: "I have ability; I have pluck, and pluck
means luck."</p>

<p>Always express confidence, faith, courage, and
cheer thoughts, whether you feel them or not.
Do this heroically and persistently, and soon the
fear shadows and weakness feelings will leave
you, and you will be in reality strong, courageous,
active, and will do things you never thought possible.</p>

<p>"As a man thinketh, so is he." Always remember
that.</p>

<p>Get hold of your thoughts; make yourself think
up, and have faith and courage. Hold to your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
resolve, and the whole world will change. You
will prosper, you will have poise, and every once
in a while happiness will come as a reward.</p>

<p>No man will be more surprised at your complete
change of attitude and character than yourself.</p>

<p>Your problems can only be solved by yourself.
Friends can advise, <i>I</i> can suggest, but YOU must
act.</p>

<p>Henceforth, never accuse yourself, never feel
sorry for your condition or position, cut out fear
thoughts,&mdash;be strong.</p>

<p>Think faith, courage, cheer, confidence, and
strength, and by-and-by the habit will be fixed
and natural.</p>

<p>This is as certain truth as I have ever experienced.
I know it. I've tried it. I've watched
others and the results are always good.</p>

<p>Don't be passive and forget this chapter. Start
right this minute to THINK RIGHT.</p>

<p>And you will never regret and never forget this
chapter on Self-accusation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dare to
Dream.</div>

<p>The great colleges turn out thousands of graduates
each year, and the great newspapers have
much sport ridiculing them in funny
pictures. Every great man was once
a boy with a dream, and that dream
came true because the boy had pep that made him
stick to his ambition and kept him from being
discouraged because of ridicule or obstacles.</p>

<p>Thomas Carlyle, the poor Scotch tutor,
dreamed he wanted to be a great author. His
clothes were threadbare, his poverty apparent.
Friends taunted and ridiculed him until, goaded
to indignation, he cried: "I have better books
in me than you have ever read." The crowd
laughed incredulously and said: "Poor fellow,
he's batty."</p>

<p>Carlyle stuck to his dream and the world has
the "History of Frederick the Great" and the
"French Revolution" and "Sartor Resartus."
When he had finished the manuscript of the
"French Revolution," a careless maid built a fire
with it. He wasn't discouraged, but went to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
work and wrote it over again and very likely better
than he wrote it the first time.</p>

<p>Bonaparte in the garden of his military school
dreamed of being a great general. He stuck to
his dream and he realized his hopes.</p>

<p>Joseph Pulitzer, a poor emigrant, crawled in a
cellar way in New York to sleep, and he dreamed
of owning a great newspaper. His dream came
true, and the newspaper is printed in a building
erected on the spot where he dreamed in the
cellar way.</p>

<p>Livingston dreamed of exploring darkest Africa;
his dream came true.</p>

<p>Edison dreamed of great electrical discoveries.
His monument is Menlo Park with its great laboratories.</p>

<p>Ford dreamed of making an automobile for the
purse-limited masses&mdash;he was jeered; to-day the
world cheers him.</p>

<p>My friend, Bert Perrine, was chucked off a
stage in the middle of Idaho's great sage brush
desert. He said to the driver, "Some day I'll own
that stage and I'll use it for a chicken house."</p>

<p>He dreamed and schemed, and to-day the desert
is the famous Twin Falls country, blossoming
like a rose. And on his beautiful ranch at Blue
Lakes, that old stage is used for a chicken house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Rockefeller dreamed, Lincoln dreamed&mdash;so
did Garfield, Wilson, Grant, Clay, Webster, Marshall
Field, Richard W. Sears and all the other
men who have done things worth while in the
world.</p>

<p>The great West is the result of dreams come
true.</p>

<p>Dream on, my boy; hitch your wagon to a
star and stay hitched. That dream and that determination
are the things that are to carry you
over obstacles, past thorny ways, and through
criticism, jeers and ridicule.</p>

<p>Your time will come. Dream and scheme, and
make your ideals materialize into living, pulsating
realities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 100%;" />
<h2>25.</h2>


<p>There are many persons who act and advocate
ideals merely for effect&mdash;they are hypocrites.</p>

<p>Here's a little true heart story that probably
passed unnoticed except to a very few persons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Real
Charity.</div>

<p>Little Spencer Nelson, a poor boy, eight years
old, recently died in a hospital with a little bank
clasped to his breast. The bank held
$3.41 in pennies which the boy had
saved to buy presents for the poor
children in his city.</p>

<p>The little hero had fought manfully through
three months' suffering, enduring the torture of
five lacerating operations. The pain failed to
dim the spirit of unselfishness which burned
brightly and clearly in his tired, fever-racked
body.</p>

<p>After each operation his mind became more
securely fixed on his project to help bring cheer
to poor children.</p>

<p>The little savings bank was his companion,
and each visitor was asked to contribute to his
fund.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>Three hours before he died, a smile beautified
his thin wasted face as the nurse dropped a dime
in his bank. His last words&mdash;a message to his
mother&mdash;were in a scarcely audible whisper,
asking her to remember to use the money to
make poor children happy.</p>

<p>That was real charity; that boy had no hypocrisy
in his heart.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Seek and
You Will
Find.</div>

<p>The daily paper chronicles instances of sensational
charity, where men vie with each other
to see who can give most and get
the most advertising. These men
overlook the wonderful opportunities
at their door&mdash;they do not realize the beautiful
love and charity that would stir in their
hearts if they would but look into the out-of-the-way
places and get direct connection with pain
and suffering.</p>

<p>Little Spencer looked from his cot and saw the
suffering of other little children and he wanted
to help them, and the very resolve and impulse
made him forget his own pain and misery.</p>

<p>In the Book of Good Deeds, the name of Spencer
Nelson will be recorded as a sweeter act of
charity than any million-dollar gift to a great institution.</p>

<p>What one of you who read these lines can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
read the story of that little hero and not be
touched by the generous love and beautiful conception
of charity he possessed.</p>

<p>I don't believe much in this far-away charity
idea so many have.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Do Good
Here At
Home.</div>

<p>I believe in helping those near where I am
rather than sending money to Siam. Poverty and
destitution, unhappily, are familiar
spectres at home, as elsewhere. He
who seeks to do good will not need to
range afar. He can find opportunity close at
home, near by, where all of us can find it if we
only look.</p>

<p>It may be a pleasurable sensation for you to
contribute fifty dollars to a missionary scheme
in Siam, and get the Missionary report of the
budget made up by the committee for the foreign
missionary fund.</p>

<p>I know that a bucket of coal in an empty stove,
a basket of bread and a liberal hunk of round
steak to the starving family around the corner
brings the donor a better sensation.</p>

<p>Take a trip to the hospitals, learn about the
homes of the suffering patients in the charity
ward, and you will resolve it's a better act to
send flour to the poor than flowers to the rich.</p>

<p>Little Spencer Nelson had the right idea of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
charity: definite, immediate help to those he could
reach right where he was, rather than sending
money to sufferers far, far away.</p>

<p>Let your gifts be principally flour and beef;
they help those who need help. Flowers are all
right in their place, but there are more places
where flour can be used to better purpose.</p>

<p>I'm keener for filling the coffee can of my suffering
neighbor than filling the coffers of the big
charity five thousand miles away.</p>

<p>I try to help both ways, but the home help
pays the bigger dividends. What do you think
about it?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 100%;" />
<h2>26.</h2>


<p>You have found a friend who has been so
much help and comfort to you. I have such a
friend too. To-night I am in the mood to think
of that friend and write him a letter like this:</p>

<div class="sidenote">What I
Think of
You.</div>

<p>This is to You. It is for You. It is about
You. You I have in mind and the good influence
you have had on me. It is a happiness
and satisfaction to know you,
and to bask in the sunshine of you.</p>

<p>The world is better because of you. You have
helped to raise the average.</p>

<p>You and your goodness&mdash;you do not appreciate
what that means. You are so modest, so
loath to think of yourself, so thoughtful of others,
so unselfish that I must tell you of you and about
you.</p>

<p>You have a warm heart that throbs for others'
woes and holds sympathy. The great world is
cold, selfish, and cares little for others. But you
are different; you are a great pillow of rest on
which I and others who love you may lay our
tired, weary heads, and you wrap your arms of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
friendship and goodness about us and feel our
very heartbeats.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What I Love
in You.</div>

<p>You with your great goodness, your quiet,
sympathetic understanding&mdash;you soothe our
troubled spirits and make us glad of
you and glad we have the precious
privilege of knowing you.</p>

<p>Even now, as I am telling you how I love
you, you are trying to wave me aside and stop
me, but I am in the mood and I want to express
myself. You know that it is a great sin of
omission to refrain from expressing our gratitude
for goodness extended to us.</p>

<p>I want to express my gratitude. I do not
want to be guilty of the sin of omission.</p>

<p>So here, then, is this little message for you,
to tell you that I appreciate you and love you,
and these words will last after you are gone and
after I am gone, to tell those of to-morrow about
you and what those of to-day thought about you.</p>

<p>Your life, your goodness, is an everlasting plant
that will flourish in many hearts. Your influence
will last beyond the calendar of time; it
is indestructible. You have a great credit in the
universal bank of good deeds, where you have
deposited worth-while acts, deeds, kindnesses,
cheer, help, friendship, sympathy, courage, grati<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>tude,
and all the most precious jewels of humanity.</p>

<p>I am happy the very moment I think of you.
I try to express myself but the feelings and
emotions I would describe have not words or
sentences to express them. You understand.
You are so big in heart, so sensitive in fabric
of feeling, so wise in understanding, that I want
you to think and feel all the genuine, noble, lovable,
appreciative thoughts you can gather together
about the one you can most appreciate.</p>

<p>Think hard, sincerely, deeply, about that one,
with all your resources of beautiful thought.
Think hard that way, and now you will begin
to understand my feelings about you, and how
I appreciate you.</p>

<p>You, my inspiration, who are so sensitized to
feeling, so delicately adjusted to read heart vibrations&mdash;you
must feel this within me that I am
trying to express. Not the love between sweethearts,
not the love of kin, not the love of friends,
but a great universal love I have for you&mdash;a
love which all who are fortunate enough to know
you have for you.</p>

<p>It is a love you cannot return to me in equal
measure, because you have not the object in me
that can merit such love. That you should love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
me in the way I love you even in the smallest
measure is satisfaction supreme.</p>

<p>It is glorious to know you. You water the
good impulses I have; you encourage all that is
noble, elevating, and bettering, in me. I shall
try to be like you&mdash;that is, so far as I can. You
are my model; there is but one <i>You</i>. Many may
copy you, none may equal you. You my comfort,
you my joy. A great glorious <i>You</i> that
a little <i>I</i> am trying to paint a picture of.</p>

<p>How futile my efforts. I might as well try
to improve the deep beautiful colors of the morning-glory,
or try to retint the lily with a more
beautiful white.</p>

<p>And so I bid you good-bye, happy that there
is such a one as you in the world&mdash;more happy
that I know you, and most happy that I know
how to appreciate you.</p>

<p>The sum of all good things I can say is, "I
love you," and the word "love" I use in its
greatest, broadest sense, which covers all the
good adjectives.</p>

<p>This is what I think of YOU.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<h2>27.</h2>


<p>There is a time in the business man's life, between
the age of 48 and 52, when he undergoes
a pronounced change.</p>

<p>More big men are cut off at 50 than at any
other age between 45 and 60.</p>

<p>From 48 to 52 most men change vitally in
their physical and mental make-up.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dangers of
Middle Life.</div>

<p>Many men&mdash;hitherto straight, moral men&mdash;go
to the bad at this time, and per contra, many
men quit their immoral and health-hurting
habits and change to moral
men. This danger period is when the
newly-rich find fault with the wives who have
helped them to their success. They grow tired
of their wives and seek the companionship of
younger women.</p>

<p>The divorce courts give most interesting figures
on this point.</p>

<p>At this danger period, men who have been
high livers, voracious eaters and heavy drinkers
find themselves victims of diabetes, Bright's disease
or other forms of kidney trouble. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
country is full of prematurely broken-down men
who have failed to heed the danger signals along
their way. To persist in self-indulgence is to
invite disaster. You must deliberately set about
to change your mode of living if you would avoid
these shoals on which so many men of middle
age have foundered.</p>

<p>Almost every man between 48 and 52 who
works indoors, eats too much, exercises too little,
sleeps insufficiently.</p>

<p>In this book I have made practical suggestions
that have been tried in the furnace of experience
and proven adequate. They have helped me;
they will help you. They will enable you to
gain pep and efficiency; they will give you a new
lease on life and make life more worth living.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Simple
Life.</div>

<p>First, live simply; eat simply. If you have in
the past, eaten rich foods, drunk fine wines, and
have been what the world knows as a
"good fellow," your course is clear.
You must call a halt on yourself.
This path leads inevitably to the graveyard. Follow
the seven simple health suggestions laid
down in an earlier chapter, and you will feel better,
feel happier and will attack the day's work
with vim and vigor.</p>

<p>Avoid undue excitement. Excitement uses up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
nerve force. It is an energy consumer. Your
mind needs repose as well as your body. When
you have finished your day's work, leave business
behind you. Do not drag it into your home.
In the evening, occupy yourself with a good,
worth-while book. Nothing is more conducive
to calm and contentment.</p>

<p>Let supper be your one hearty meal of the day.
And after supper, play with the kids or joke
with your wife; get a smile on your face. When
you are home, interest yourself in home concerns.
The "home men" are the men who live
longest. They lead healthy, regular lives, and
they keep alive the outside interests that make
for peace, poise, content and happiness.</p>

<p>Keep a sharp look-out for tendencies to change
your habits and morals.</p>

<p>At 50 you are walking on thin ice; look out,
danger is near.</p>

<p>After you are 55, your habits are pretty well
established. If you have lived rightly till then,
you're safe thereafter and very likely are on your
way to a good ripe old age if you take reasonable
care of yourself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<h2>28.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Our Sons.</div>

<p>We love our own the best; maybe that's why
we indulge our own too much. Our duty to our
boys; that's a subject as old as the
hills, and it is as important as it is
old. It is a subject that has come to the forefront
in recent years. Multitudes of paid juvenile
workers and sociological experts throughout
the country are engaged in the work of keeping
the youth of the nation healthily occupied
and away from corrupting influences.</p>

<p>Modern conditions have created a "boy problem"
which was unknown two generations ago.
Then there were no slums reeking with vice
and squalor and ugliness. The era of great manufacturing
enterprises was just beginning. There
were no densely populated cities numbering millions
of souls. Amusements were simple. Everywhere
were stretches of open country, and boys
were allowed to run wild in field and woodland
and stream.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Times Have
Changed.</div>

<p>The great cities of to-day have done away with
all this. The good, old-fashioned, healthful
re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>creations have disappeared in all but
rural communities. In their place
has come the lurid "movie" with
its tales of crime and violence and passion. At
every crowded street corner, vice beckons, and
glaring signs lure the curious boy into the vicious
cabaret and dance-hall.</p>

<p>To-day I had the boy problem forcibly presented
to me. I saw in a court twenty-four boys
who had been brought before the Judge charged
with petty crimes. Three were sent to the penitentiary,
seven to the reform school and fourteen
let go temporarily on good behavior.</p>

<p>A friend of mine interested in criminology
tells me the great bulk of hold-ups, thefts, burglaries
and murders are committed by boys between
16 and 22 years of age.</p>

<p>These twenty-four boys I mentioned were just
ordinary boys, capable of making good citizens
if they had had the right kind of home treatment
and surroundings. Most of them got in trouble
through their association with the "gang" or
the "bunch," or the "crowd," and this because
daddy didn't have his hand on the rein.</p>

<p>That boy must have companionship; he must
have a confidant with whom he can share his
joys, his sorrows, his hopes, his ambitions. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
he doesn't get this comeraderie at home, he gets
it "'round the corner."</p>

<p>We know where the boy is when he is at school,
but how few of us know the boy's doings between
times.</p>

<p>Pool halls tempt the boys, and these resorts
are breeding places where filthy stories, criminal
slang and evil practices are hatched.</p>

<p>Pool halls and saloons invite and fascinate the
boy. He sees the lights. There is a keen pleasure
in watching the pink-shirted dude with
cigarette in his mouth making fancy shots.</p>

<p>There is no one to nag him or bother him; it
gets to be his "hang-out," and soon he drifts
into a crowd that knows the trail to the red-light
district.</p>

<p>Painted fairies dazzle the giddy boy. It takes
money to go the pace. Crime is gilded over with
slang words. Stealing is called "easy money."
Robbery is "turning a trick," and so on.</p>

<p>A boy becomes what he lives on mentally and
physically; that's the net of it.</p>

<p>It is a common saying, but a good one, that
the boys of to-day are the men of to-morrow.
If you train a boy with care and kindness, he
will grow up to be an honest and upright citizen.
But let him run a wild, undisciplined course,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
leave him free to explore the crime-spots and
plague-pools of the city, and sooner or later his
moral fibre is weakened and ultimately snaps.
At best he will become an indifferent citizen;
at worst a drifter or a criminal.</p>

<p>There is nothing better for a boy than discipline
properly administered. And that brings up
the whole matter of army life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Army:
A Maker
of Men.</div>

<p>The army is a great maker and developer of
men. Boys who were headed for perdition have
found in the army a new sense of honor and
respect. The rigorous training, the
idea of duty, the heroic traditions of
the service&mdash;all these are renewers
and rekindlers of manhood. Many a lad who
has wasted his health, wealth and substance on
the primrose path, has "come back" gloriously
in the service of the flag.</p>

<p>Look at the average soldier or sailor you meet.
His skin is tanned by sun and wind to a deep
brown. His eyes are crystal clear. There is
youth and strength in his tread. There he stands,
clean as a whistle. No fat, no flabbiness&mdash;just
solid sinew and ruddy health. He is a living exponent
of what military training can do for every
boy in the country.</p>

<p>Hard work, strength-building exercises, suffi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>cient
sleep, regular hours, simple, wholesome
food, systematic training&mdash;these are the things
the army and navy offers. And these are the
things that make real men.</p>

<p>But no training that school or church or army
can give him relieves you, Dad, of your obligation
to the boy. In the last analysis, it is <i>your</i>
influence that will either make him or break him,
for it is to you that he looks for guidance and
comradeship in his most impressionable years.</p>

<p>If you are his chum, if sister shares his amusements
with him, if the family work and live on
the "all for one and one for all" basis, if the
boy is kept busy and interested, he can be easily
trained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Be Worth
Copying.</div>

<p>Neglect him and he will neglect you. Love
him and he will love you. Meet him half way,
he's impressionable. Show him a
kindness, he will respond. Show him
a good example, he will follow. You
have to be with him, or know where he is every
minute.</p>

<p>During his period of adolescence, say from
twelve or thirteen years to sixteen or seventeen,
that boy is a mass of plaster of paris, easily
shaped while plastic, but once set, all but impossible
to recast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>That's the time, Dad, you must be on YOUR
job with your boy.</p>

<p>Your counsel, example, love, interest and teaching
will MAKE the boy.</p>

<p>Think of these things, Dad, and think hard,
and think hard NOW. To-morrow may be too
late.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<h2>29.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Our
Daughters.</div>

<p>Our daughters&mdash;how much we love them!
How happy we are to have their fresh, smiling
faces about us! Their girlish laughter
lightens our home hours and creates
an atmosphere of joy. What
would we not give if we could but insure their
happiness! Our fondest and most cherished
hopes are bound up in them as they grow up
under our eyes and blossom into womanhood.</p>

<p>Girl, what a wonderful creature you can be.
What a glorious success you can make of your
life if you get the right start, find the right hands
to help you, the right hearts to love you, and the
right eyes to watch you, the right thoughts to
make you, and the right ideals to guide you.</p>

<p>There are so many influences to spoil you&mdash;so
much convention, so much artificiality, so
much snobbery, so much caste, so much foolish
frivolity.</p>

<p>Then there are the wrong examples, the wrong
grooming, the wrong environments, the wrong
influences surrounding you. Really, it is not to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
be wondered at why so many girls lose their
heads and make a fizzle of their young lives.</p>

<p>The fizzle is generally made because daddy and
mama have a lot of foolish notions about bringing
up girls. Especially is this so if the parents
are wealthy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Wrong
Way.</div>

<p>Here is the history of many a rich girl: She
is born without welcome, fed on a bottle, reared
by a nurse, grows up in a nursery,
becomes estranged from her mother;
later on, she is sent away to school,
mixes with a lot of other rich girls, gets lots of
foolish notions, false estimates, and prejudiced
views. She graduates and comes home, and then,
to commemorate the event, there are a lot of
"doings" which she attends. Following this is
the show-off, which is called a debut.</p>

<p>She is exhibited like a filly at the horse show,
and some high-collared young man wins her
head, although she thinks it's her heart. She
believes it is the proper time for her to marry,
and he is such "a swell fellow," he is such "good
company," and he "dances so well"&mdash;these
qualities win her head.</p>

<p>So the girl marries and has children; the husband
goes broke, and the girl awakens to the
necessity of coming down from her pedestal, fac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>ing
stern necessity, and raising her children as
her mother should have raised her.</p>

<p>That's the picture of the poor rich girl whose
parents are to blame for the nonsense she
crammed into her head.</p>

<p>But, you, Girl&mdash;you are going to learn your
cooking on a gas range instead of a chafing dish;
you'll learn to bake bread before fudge; you'll
learn how to cook solids before you learn to make
salads.</p>

<p>You will combine simplicity, sentiment, sense
sereneness, sweetness, rather than envy, frills,
feathers and foolishness.</p>

<p>God's noblest calling for woman is the raising
of children and the founding of a home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cooking and
Sewing.</div>

<p>To cook and sew is a higher duty and better
occupation than bridge parties and society. Not
that you must cook and sew, my dear,
but that you should be able to in
case the need should arise. With the
ability to cook and sew, you can properly direct
the cook or seamstress, and they will respect you
for your education.</p>

<p>I want you to be golden girls&mdash;girls who love
home and children; girls who love simple things,
natural things. I want you to be sweet rather
than pretty, lovable rather than popular.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Do not look upon matrimony as a means to
provide food and finery for yourself.</p>

<p>Do not be ashamed of an old-fashioned mother.
Do not be a "good fellow." Do not be afraid
to say, "I can't afford it."</p>

<p>Help the family. Be part of it, and not apart
from it.</p>

<p>When you are old enough to have a beau, do
not be afraid to bring him into your home, no
matter how humble it is.</p>

<p>Do not esteem your boy friends for the amount
of money they spend on your entertainment.
Happiness does not consist of lobster-suppers and
taxi-rides to the theatre. Ten cents will bring
just as much real happiness as ten dollars spent
for mere display.</p>

<p>Be modest, girls; it is your greatest asset.</p>

<p>Don't gossip or belittle other girls. Find the
good you can say of others; that quality makes
you more attractive.</p>

<p>Watch out for candied words and flattery;
these things mark the hypocrite, and a hypocrite
is an abomination. Flattery is a practiced deceit&mdash;a
dishonorable bait to catch affections.</p>

<p>Do not allow any young man to relate a story
in your presence that has the slightest risque
turn to it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>Show by your words and your actions that
such presumption is an insult.</p>

<p>Be square with yourself; be square to the man
who is after your heart. Put yourself mentally
in the place of a wife when a man gets serious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Right
Man.</div>

<p>Don't hurry, girls; don't judge the man by his
money prospects but by his character and ambition.
Have nothing to do with any
young suitor who isn't always kind,
considerate and attentive to his
mother. And when real love comes to you and
you decide to marry, marry a man of character
who courts you in the sweet, simple, old way.</p>

<p>If a young man spends money extravagantly
before marriage, hard times will always be around
during his married life.</p>

<p>The most precious possessions in the world are
happiness and love, and these come from simple
things, genuineness, and usefulness.</p>

<p>The painted, powdered, tinsel, fluff, feathers
and furbelow girl may be a dashing creature now,
and you may envy her, but you, with your quiet,
sweet, simple, sensible ways&mdash;you will win real
love, real respect, real affection, real pleasures,
real satisfaction, in all the days to come; you
will make a success of your life.</p>

<p>Frills and feathers may have an attraction for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the girl who makes a fizzle of her life, but sweetness
and simplicity, sentiment and sense, are
precious jewels that will endure for all time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Road
to Unhappiness.</div>

<p>The world is full of new-fashioned, slangy,
dancy, fancy, foolish girls who marry for style,
stunts and society, and their married
life is failure, worry and regret.
They do not realize, poor things, until
it is too late, that money and luxury are not
enough to bring happiness. When this truth
comes home to them, there is nothing left but
disillusion, heartache and sorrow.</p>

<p>Be the golden, pure, old-fashioned, sweet, simple,
quiet, modest girl who knows things, rather
than one who is a show-off girl.</p>

<p>When the right young man comes along, he
will recognize the kind of girl you are when he
meets you. He will see in you a girl of pure
gold; a sweet, natural, sensible girl, who will be a
helpmate to him and not a drawback.</p>

<p>So then, here is the hope that you, girl, will
start right, keep right, and end right. I want
you to think of sense, sentiment, and simplicity
rather than dances, dollars, duds and doings.</p>

<p>I want your life to be one of poise, happiness
and serenity instead of noise, worry and nerves.</p>

<p>This little message is all for you&mdash;GIRL.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<h2>30.</h2>


<p>Many churches to-day are running to extremes
in one way or another.</p>

<p>On the one hand, they are conducted along
the lines of form, ceremony and ritualism; the
other extreme results in excitement, ecstasy and
fanaticism.</p>

<p>The church of forms, rituals and ceremonies
attracts the passive who are willing to let the
priest or pastor or prelate take charge of the
religious work while they, the attendants or worshippers,
sit quietly by and say "amen" and join
in the responses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Real
Religion.</div>

<p>Paul said, "Away with those forms." Christ,
in ministering to humanity, gave no forms and
made no set sentences for his followers.
The Lord's Prayer was given
with the admonition, "After this
manner pray ye," and certainly not with the command,
"Pray ye with these words."</p>

<p>Form, ceremony and ritual are much like most
associated charities&mdash;a sort of convention.
Forms cannot express the deep emotions, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
natural longings, or the human desires; they are
echoes, hollow and unsatisfying.</p>

<p>For those who do not feel, for those who do not
act, for those who belong to churches because of
convention, or for social reasons, forms and frills
fill the bill.</p>

<p>Form is an exterior religion, an outward show.
Form doesn't touch the heart or awaken the soul.
Form in religion is like a formal dinner. It is
a gaudy display rather than a plan to satisfy human
heart hunger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Scare-You-to-Death"
Method.</div>

<p>Opposite to formal religion is the frenzied
"scare-you-to-death" excitement method, which
relies upon mental intoxication to stir
the people. Like other forms of intoxication,
the effect soon wears off.</p>

<p>I have little patience or sympathy for the business
men who hire professional evangelists to
come to town to start revivals. The sensational
revivalists have too acute an appreciation of the
dollar to convince me of their sincerity in their
work.</p>

<p>A laborer is worthy of his hire, and a preacher,
teacher or benefactor of any sort should be well
paid. But when I see these big guns taking away
from ten to one hundred thousand dollars in cold
cash for a three weeks' campaign converting the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
poor suffering people, the thought comes to me
that if the evangelist were sincere, he would buy
a lot of bread, coal and underwear, and hire a lot
of trained nurses with a big part of that money.</p>

<p>Christ and his Apostles were of the people;
they worked with and among the people; they
had no committees, no guarantees and no business
men's subscription lists.</p>

<p>It's mighty hard to read about these sensational
evangelists taking in thousands of dollars
for a couple of weeks' revival meetings, and harmonize
that religion with the religion of Christ,
the carpenter, and his Apostles, who were fishermen
and workmen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How They
Do It.</div>

<p>The exciting, intoxicating, frenzied revival
method is pretty much the same in its working
wherever it is practised. The evangelist
starts in with the song,
"Where is My Wandering Boy To-night;"
then follows the picture of mother, which
is painted with sobs of blood. Then follows
mother's death-bed scene until the audience is in
tears. Gesticulation, mimicry, acting, sensationalism,
slang and weepy stories follow, until the
ferment of excitement is developed to a high
pitch, and droves flock down the sawdust trail to
be made over on the instant into sanctified beings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>The evangelist stays until his engagement is
up, and then departs with a pocket full of nice
fat bank drafts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Old-Time
Method.</div>

<p>But there is nothing new about this method.
It is as old as humanity. It is the same method
that is practised in the more remote
and uncivilized portions of the world
to-day, where garishly painted savages
congregate and render homage to their
gods in an orgy of yelling, whooping and beating
of the tom-tom.</p>

<p>It is a sad commentary on the established profession
of the ministry that sensational professionals
are called in and paid fabulous prices to
convert the people in their community.</p>

<p>I do not take much stock in either the frigid
form-and-ceremonial method with its frills, or the
frenzied fire-and-brimstone, scare-you-to-it extreme.</p>

<p>Somewhere between these extremes is the rational,
natural, sane road to travel&mdash;the religion
of brotherly love; of cheers, not tears; of hope,
not fear; of courage, not weakness; of joy, not
sorrow; of help, not hindrance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Religion
of Love.</div>

<p>The religion that makes us love one another
here&mdash;not the kind that says we shall know each
other there; the religion that has to do with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>human passions, human trials, human
needs, instead of the frigid form or
the fevered frenzy; the religion that
avoids the extremes of heat and cold&mdash;that's the
kind the world needs most.</p>

<p>Christ taught love, kindness, charity. He spoke
not of beautiful churches and opera-singing
choirs. He spoke not of robes, vestments, forms
or rituals.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful things in the Bible
is the story of the good Samaritan with his simple,
unostentatious aid to a wounded man&mdash;a
man whom the Samaritan knew as an enemy of
his people, but who was none the less a brother.
And you will remember how the priest of the
temple&mdash;the man who taught charity and love&mdash;drew
up his skirts and passed the wounded
man by.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<h2>31.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Love of
Country.</div>

<p>Patriotism&mdash;one's love for one's country&mdash;is
a natural and a beautiful sentiment. With the
spirit of idealism behind it, it becomes
one of the noblest sentiments
that has been developed in the course
of humanity's long upward march to civilization.</p>

<p>To-day, on Europe's battlefields, millions of
men are hazarding their lives. They do so gladly,
willingly, with a firm and reasoned conviction in
the justice of the cause for which they fight. That
is intelligent patriotism&mdash;the kind of patriotism
that is based on understanding and knowledge.</p>

<p>But the world to-day is conscious that there is
another kind of patriotism&mdash;a false patriotism
that is fostered and fomented by ambitious governments
for purposes of aggression and aggrandizement.</p>

<p>This false patriotism is not a free or voluntary
thing. It is the blind, instinctive feeling of sheep-like
men who have been bred beneath the yoke
of servility and obedience and are like clay in the
hands of their overlords. They know not why<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
they fight, but through fear or intimidation or
force, they slavishly submit to the will of their
Kaiser or Emperor and his minions.</p>

<p>This great war, and most every great war of
the past, was made possible by a distorted understanding
of patriotism. This false patriotism is
one of the narrowest and most cruel forces in the
world, and when linked with militarism, it becomes
the most dangerous. It causes wars, waste
and desolation. It creates jealousies, inspires
jingoism and braggadocio, keeps alive the fight
spirit, and menaces the peace and security of nations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Militarism.</div>

<p>Militaristic rulers, fired by selfish egotism,
know full well what a powerful force patriotism
is, and they nurse the babes with
fatherland stuff and give them tin
soldiers to play with and tin helmets to wear.</p>

<p>Patriotism, when it reflects love of the place
of one's nativity, when it is based on home ties
and associations, is a beautiful and touching
thing. But when unscrupulous autocrats utilize
this sentiment for their own aggressive purposes,
it becomes a menace that must be put down if
other nations are to enjoy the blessings of peace
and liberty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">False
Patriotism
a Menace.</div>

<p>To keep this false patriotism alive, wars must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>be made, so that human blood can be secured to
keep the monster from famishing.
And so, on slight pretexts, or no pretexts
at all, the war lords and imperial
autocrats rattle their swords in their scabbards
and let loose the avalanche of war on the
world.</p>

<p>Such patriotism is failure and worse than failure.
It is a reversion to the brute age of mankind.
It flings a moral challenge to the world
that the world must either accept or perish.</p>

<p>So much for this monstrous perversion of Right
and Reason that has turned Europe into a shambles,
and has banded the civilized nations of the
world together in a mighty struggle for freedom
and democracy.</p>

<p>True patriotism is one of the world's constructive
forces. It overleaps national frontiers, and
is inspired by the ideals of international peace,
good-will and amity. It looks forward to the
time when national barriers will be let down, and
the brotherhood of man will be recognized the
world over.</p>

<p>Such patriotism is the patriotism of Right
Makes Might&mdash;not Might Makes Right. It is
the kind of patriotism that prevails only among
the free, democratic, peace-loving peoples of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
world who are fighting to-day for the preservation
of free institutions and the rights of humanity.</p>

<p>The opposite sort of patriotism is the autocratic,
militaristic kind that has furnished the
world with an example of savage ferocity and
vindictive cruelty that it will not soon forget.</p>

<p>In this great struggle, we see Democracy
ranged against Autocracy, Right against Might,
True Patriotism against False Patriotism. The
Right will triumph, as it always has, when pitted
against the forces of hate, greed and reaction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<h2>32.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">The Happy
Medium.</div>

<p>Danger lies in extremes. Too much of anything
is bad for the human being's health. There
is a certain comfortable proportion of
exercise and rest which, when mixed
together, will give bodily efficiency.
Too much exercise is bad, too little is bad.</p>

<p>Until recent years, our vocations and the habit
of going to or from our places of business gave
us a well-balanced amount of exercise, rest, work
and pleasure, and all went well.</p>

<p>Lately, we hear much about worry, neurasthenia,
nervous prostration and the like. There
are several contributing causes to the mental and
physical ills which are caused by "nerves."</p>

<p>First of all, we have an epidemic of labor-saving
devices. The principal argument used by the
manufacturer of a labor-saving device is, "It
makes money and saves work." Making money
and getting soft snaps seem to be the objectives
of most human beings.</p>

<p>The labor-saving devices take away exercise.
The machine does the work. The artisan simply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
feeds the hopper, puts in a new roll, or drops in
the material. He sits down and watches the
wheels go around, likely smoking a cigarette in
the meanwhile, and more than likely reading the
sporting sheet of a yellow newspaper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Changed
Conditions
of Work.</div>

<p>Possibly few of my readers have given the
matter serious thought, and they will be astounded
at the changed conditions of work
which have come into our modern
life. It will be interesting to note
here some of these changes.</p>

<p>Men used to live within walking distance of
their work. Now the electric street railway and
the speedy automobile have eliminated the necessity
for much walking.</p>

<p>Men used to climb stairs. The elevator has
now so accustomed us to the conveniences that
stairs are taboo.</p>

<p>Machines have replaced muscles. The old
printer walked from case to case and got exercise.
To-day he sits in an easy backed chair and
uses a linotype.</p>

<p>Telephoning is quicker than traveling. No one
"runs for a doctor."</p>

<p>Our houses have electric washers, electric irons
and many other labor-saving devices.</p>

<p>Even the farmer has his telephone, his auto,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
his riding plow, his milking machine and his
cream separator.</p>

<p>In the stores, the cash boy has disappeared.
The cash carrier takes the money to a girl who
sits in the office, a machine makes the change,
and another machine does her mathematics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Perils of
Inactivity.</div>

<p>The modern idea of efficiency puts a premium
on the sedentary feature of occupations, and employees
are frequently automatons that
sit. The business man sits at his
desk, sits in a comfortable automobile
as he goes home, sits at the dinner table and
sits all evening at the theater, or at the card
table. It is sit, sit, sit until he gets a big abdomen,
a puffy skin and a bad liver.</p>

<p>He tries to counteract this with forced exercise
in a gymnasium or a couple of hours golfing
a week. Very likely, his golfing is more interesting
because of the side bets than because of
the exercise.</p>

<p>We are losing out on the natural, pleasurable,
and practical exercises, mixed in the right proportions
to promote physical poise and health.
Things are too easy, luxury and comfort too teasing,
for the ordinary mortal to resist, and the
great mob sits or rides hundreds of times when
they should stand or walk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>When my objective point is five or six blocks,
I walk, and I think on the way. I probably get in
from two to four miles of walking every day,
which my friends would save by riding in the
street cars or autos.</p>

<p>I walk to my office every morning&mdash;a distance
of nearly four miles.</p>

<p>I walk alone, so that I may relax and not expend
conscious effort as is the case when I walk
with another.</p>

<p>That morning walk prevents me from reading
slush and worthless news, and relieves me of the
necessity of talking and using up nerve energy.</p>

<p>I get the worth-while news from my paper by
the headlines and by trained ability to separate
the wheat from the chaff.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Four Great
Body-Builders.</div>

<p>I just feel fine all the time, and it's because I
get to bed early, sleep plenty, exercise naturally,
think properly and get the four great
body-builders in plenty: air, water,
sunshine, food; and the other four
great health-builders, which are: good thought,
good exercise, good rest, and good cheer.</p>

<p>The great crowd aims at ease, and so the business
man sits and loses out on the exercise his
body and mind must have. And therefore the
great crowd pays tribute to doctors, sanitariums,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
rest cures, fake tonics, worthless medicines, freakish
diet fads, and crazy cults, isms, and discoveries
that claim to bring health by the easy, lazy,
comfortable sitting route.</p>

<p>Believe me, dear reader, it is not in the cards to
play the game of health that way. "There ain't
no sich animal" said the ruben as he saw the
giraffe in the circus, and likewise, there "aint no
sich thing" as health and happiness for the man

ease where exercise is demanded.</p>

<h2>33.</h2>


<p>This afternoon I am sitting on a glacial rock in
the forest at the foot of Mount Shasta. A beautiful
spot in which to rest and a glorious page
from the book of nature to read.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Back to
Nature.</div>

<p>A canopy of deepest blue sky above, with sunshine
unstopped by clouds. The rays of old Sol
pulsate themselves into an endless
variety of flowers, plants and vegetable
life which Mother Earth has given
birth to. Glorious trees of magnificent size reach
up into the blue and give us shade. Ozone sweeps
gently through the forest, impregnated with the
perfume of fir, balsam, cedar, pine and flowers.</p>

<p>In this spot, nature has thrown up mountains
of volcanic rock, which hold the winter's snow in
everlasting supply to quench the thirst of plant,
of animal, and of the millions of humans in the
lower country.</p>

<p>The whole hillside around me is a community
of springs of crystal water laden with iron and
precious salts. It is the breast of Mother Earth
which nurses her offspring.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>Here are no noises of the street; the newsboy's
cry of "extra" is not heard. The raucous voice
of the peddler, the din of trucks, the honk of automobiles,
the clatter of the city&mdash;all these are
absent.</p>

<p>There is no noise here&mdash;just the sweet music
of falling water, and the aeolian lullaby made by
the breeze playing on the pine needles.</p>

<p>My eyes take in a panorama of beautiful nature
in colors and contrasts that would give stage
fright to any artist who tried to paint the scenes
on canvas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gaining
Pep.</div>

<p>I am getting pep. This is my treatment for
tired nerves; 'tis the "medcin' of the hills;" 'tis
nature's cure, and how it brings the
pill box and the bottle of tonic into
contempt! I'm letting down the high
tension voltage and getting the calm, natural pulsation
that nature intended the human machine
to have.</p>

<p>So quiet, so peaceful, so natural is the view that
I drink in inspiration of a worth-while kind. No
war news to read, no records of tragedy, no degrading
chronicles of man's passions, of man's
meanness and man's selfishness.</p>

<p>A little chipmunk sits upright on a rock before
me wondering at the movements of my yellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
pencil and the black mark it makes on the paper.</p>

<p>A delicate lace-winged insect lights on my tablet,
and a saucy "camp robber," or mutton bird,
wonders at the unusual sight of me, the big man
animal brother. A big beetle is getting his provisions
for the winter. I recognize his occupation,
for I've read about him in Fabre's wonderful
books on insect life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nature's
Lodge.</div>

<p>Here, in the sanctum sanctorum of the forest,
I am made a member of Nature's lodge, and the
ants and bugs and beetles and flowers
and plants and trees are initiating me
and telling me the secrets of the order.
I can only tell you, who are in the great busy
world outside, the lessons and morals. The real
secrets I must not tell; you will receive them
when you, too, come to the hills and forests, and
sit down on a rock alone and go through the initiation.</p>

<p>You are invited to come in; your application is
approved, and you are eligible to membership.</p>

<p>Come to Nature's lodge-meeting and clear away
the cobwebs from your weary brain; get inspiration
and be a man again.</p>

<p>Come&mdash;soothe and rest and build up those
shredded, weakened, tired, weary nerves. Let the
sun put its coat of health on you, and let the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
ozone put the red blood of strength in your veins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rest and
Recreate.</div>

<p>Come and get perfect brain and body-resting
sleep. Come to this wonderful, happy, helpful
lodge and get a store of energy, and
an abundance of vital ammunition
with which to make the fight, when
you go back to your factory or office. The doctor
can lance the carbuncle, but Nature's outdoor
medicine will prevent your having a carbuncle.</p>

<p>The doctor can stop a pain with a poison drug,
but Nature's outdoor medicine will prevent your
having the disorder which makes the pain.</p>

<p>No, brother, you can't get health out of a bottle
or a pill box. But you <i>can</i> get it from Mother
Nature's laboratory, where she compounds air,
water, sunshine, beauty, music, thought; where
she gives you exercise and rest, health, happiness,
all summed up into cashable assets for the human
in the shape of poise, efficiency and peace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mother.</div>

<p>Mother, you are the one person in all the world
whose kindness was never the preface to a request.
That's the sweetest tribute we
can pay you, and the most truthful
one. It covers devotion, love, sentiment, motherhood,
and all the noble attributes that go to make
the word "Mother" the most hallowed, most sacred,
most beautiful word in the English language.</p>

<p>There are not words or sentences that can express
to you what we think of you or convey our
appreciation of you.</p>

<p>You want our love; you have it. You should
be told of our love; we tell you. Appreciation and
gratitude are payments on account, but with all
our appreciation and with our whole life's gratitude,
the debt we are under can never be paid.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>We've hurt you, Mother, many times, by our
thoughtlessness and by the resentment we felt
over your plans and your views about the things
we did, and you have had heartaches because of
such actions of ours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mother
Love.</div>

<p>Forgive us, Mother, we're sorry.  And there
you are, dear; the moment we ask your forgiveness,
your great, tender, loving heart
has forgiven us and erased the marks
of transgression. Always thinking of
us, always excusing us, always doing for us, always
watching us and always loving us in the
most unselfish way.</p>

<p>We love you, Mother; we appreciate you. We
are going to show our appreciation and love so
much more from now on. We have just come to
our senses and realized what a wonderful, necessary,
helpful being you are.</p>

<p>Your sweetness, your gentleness, your goodness,
your love, are parts of you. They all go to
make up that word "Mother."</p>

<p>Your life, your acts, your example, your Motherhood,
have all helped the world so much more
than you will ever know.</p>

<p>In the everlasting record of good deeds, your
name is in gold.</p>

<p>In the everlasting memory of those who appre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>ciate
you, your face, your life, is a sacred, helpful
picture that grows more beautiful as the days
pass.</p>

<p>In tenderness, in appreciation, in love, let us
dedicate these thoughts and voice these expressions
to Mother, who gives her life by inches, and
who would give it all on the instant for her children,
if necessity called for the sacrifice.</p>

<p>There have been so many beautiful things written
about Mother and all the rest of the family
that it is high time we should tell you
how much we love you and how much
we appreciate you.</p>

<p>You've worked so hard; you've been so ambitious
to do things for your loved ones, and they
have accepted your sacrifice and work and watchfulness
as matter of fact.</p>

<p>You've had dreams of a some day when you
would relax and play and enjoy, but you have set
that some day too far ahead. You consider yourself
only after all your loved ones are comfortable
and happy, and time is passing, Dad.</p>

<p>You are too unselfish, too much centered in that
some day. Let's change things a bit, Dad. Sometimes
the "some day" doesn't come.</p>

<p>You are entitled to happiness and pleasure and
health and joy right here, now, to-day. It's your
duty to have them.</p>

<p>Your loved ones do not want you to spend your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
health in getting wealth. They don't want to see
you worn-out, tired, weary and unhappy, in the
evening of your life. Besides it's your duty to let
them share the responsibility, and work out their
own problems. They will be better equipped for
life after you are gone if you let them gain knowledge
by practical experience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Keep Alive
the Spirit
of Youth.</div>

<p>Come on, Dad; get in the group and enjoy
things now and you will live longer, and get more
out of life, and give more pleasure
to your loved ones. Get in the game,
Dad; let's see the old light and twinkle
in your eyes; let's have the sunshine on your
face; the love-light on your lips, and the happiness
in your heart.</p>

<p>Leave your cares at the office; prepare your
mind for play, and you will feel so much better
and stronger and so much more successful in
your business.</p>

<p>We don't want to hear any more sh-h-h&mdash;sh-h-h&mdash;or
whispers when you come home. We
don't want to feel that uncomfortable feeling of
restraint; let's laugh and sing and love and play&mdash;let's
make your home-coming a joyous event.</p>

<p>We all love you, Dad, but you haven't made it
as comfortable as you might for us when we try
to express our love. You've been too tired, too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
busy, too much occupied with those business
thoughts.</p>

<p>Don't you see how we love you and how we
appreciate you? Don't you know that there is no
one in the world who can take the place of Dad?</p>

<p>Keep your heart young, Dad; we will help if

<h2>36.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">What Our
Bodies are
Composed Of.</div>

<p>We speak of the three kingdoms: the animal,
the vegetable and the mineral kingdoms, and
every substance is classified into one
of these. The exact truth is there is
but one kingdom, which is the mineral.
The vegetable substances and animal combinations
are made of mineral elements.</p>

<p>In a rough way we distinguish the mineral
kingdom as those substances called elements,
such as iron, sulphur, carbon, oxygen, hydrogen,
sodium and the like.</p>

<p>These elements are unchangeable in themselves;
they do not grow. The animal is made
of mineral elements associated in certain proportions,
such as albumin, carbon, lime, water, salt
and the like. The vegetable kingdom also consists
of these various chemical combinations.</p>

<p>Seed, when planted, extracts the minerals from
the air and the earth and combines them into a
plant, which grows and has for its object the making
of seeds to reproduce and perpetuate itself.</p>

<p>The plant has life, but it has no spiritual or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
mental equipment, and therein vegetable life differs
from the animal life. The animal eats vegetable
and animal flesh. Through the vegetable he
gets the mineral matter necessary for body-building.
He also gets a plentiful supply of mineral
from the flesh he eats, which flesh was first
built up through the vegetables the animal ate.</p>

<p>These are definite facts.</p>

<p>The human body may be analyzed and separated
into something like a dozen substances,
among which are water, which is three-fourths of
the body's structure, carbon, lime, phosphorus,
iron, potassium, salt and so on.</p>

<p>By reading a book on anatomy you can learn
just exactly the proportions of the substances in
the human body.</p>

<p>All these chemicals are formed in the shape of
little cells, myriads of which are in the body.
These cells are constantly being destroyed and
new ones made to take their place.</p>

<p>Parts of the body are replaced every twenty-four
hours; other parts less often.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Our
Bodies Need.</div>

<p>Scientists tell us that the whole body is replaced
every seven years. Every move you make
destroys cells which nature has to replace.
Isn't it reasonable then to conclude
that if a man should fail to eat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
enough lime for his body-building, his bones
would suffer? If he does not get enough iron,
his blood will suffer, and so on. I am convinced
that most physical ailments are caused by a deficiency
of the mineral elements in the body.</p>

<p>Phosphorus and potash are necessary to human
welfare. These elements are in the husk of the
wheat, and when the husk is taken off in making
flour, the resulting product is mostly starch. The
person who lives mostly on white bread will suffer
from lack of phosphorus and potash.</p>

<p>Nothing could be better for the health of the
American people than the nation-wide food campaigns
the government is conducting. The educational
value of these campaigns is enormous.</p>

<p>Eat less wheat! White bread is unessential.
Bran, or whole wheat bread, is far more healthful
and nourishing, and contains more of the elements
the human body needs.</p>

<p>Eat more fruit. People do not eat enough fruit.
Every year thousands of bushels of peaches and
grapes and other fruit go to waste because the
demand is not great enough to ship the entire output
to the great consuming centers.</p>

<p>Study your body's needs. Health is maintained
at its proper level only so long as you eat carefully
and wisely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 100%;" />
<h2>37.</h2>


<p>The practice of medicine in the past has been
directed towards the curing of disease and physical
ailments already developed. The practice of
medicine in the future is to be along preventive
lines. Science is showing us how to prevent infection.
Science is fighting the deadly microbe
which comes to us in the air we breathe, the water
we drink, and the food we eat, and the infected
things we touch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The "Why"
of Disease.</div>

<p>Nature has supplied the human body with a
home guard of necessary bacteria, and in the circulation
system are phagocytes which
fight the invading microbes and generally
destroy them. When the system
is weakened through disease, through lack of
exercise, or through improper food, disease has an
easy time.</p>

<p>I want you to remember this golden prescription.
It is composed of the following: Good Air,
Good Water, Good Sunshine, Good Food, Good
Exercise, Good Cheer, Good Rest and Good
Thought. If you take this golden prescription,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
you will make of yourself a giant in brain and
brawn strength.</p>

<p>You can't get health out of a bottle. You can't
get the system to absorb iron if you take it in the
form of tincture of iron. You can eat a pound of
rust, which is oxide of iron, and none of that iron
will be absorbed in the system.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What
to Eat.</div>

<p>As I have explained in another chapter, you
must take the mineral in the system through the
vegetable route. You will get iron
that will be assimilated when you eat
beefsteak. Beefsteak has blood; the
blood has iron. You will also get iron when
you eat spinach.</p>

<p>Every element necessary for your body is found
in some vegetable or animal food; therefore, you
should refrain from confining yourself to a very
few articles of food.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fads, Cults,
Isms.</div>

<p>Don't pay any attention to the faddist who
gives you a rigorous diet or unpalatable food. You
simply make yourself miserable, and
you generate more worry and unhappiness
by your discipline than the
good you get from these freak fads. There are
a thousand different fads and cults and isms, each
one claiming to be right. Probably each one contains
a small portion of right. But it is a sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
thing that The Right is too big a thing to be confined
within narrow formulae and creeds.</p>

<p>We all eat too much meat, but that a strict vegetarian
diet is the necessary thing for good health
I deny. The sheep, the cow, and horse are vegetarians,
and they are short lived. The eagle, the
lion, the man, eat animal food, and they are long
lived.</p>

<p>I may be prejudiced, but it does seem to me
that the strict vegetarians are a skinny, sallow-looking
lot of humans, speaking generally. I do
find that the healthier specimens of vegetarians
are those who eat plenty of eggs and drink plenty
of milk, both of which are animal food, and both
of which have nearly all the elements necessary
to sustain life.</p>

<p>I don't like fads in the matter of eating. The
amount a person consumes should be in exact
accord with the body's requirements&mdash;neither
more nor less.</p>

<p>The human body is a machine from a food
standpoint. It is an engine that has work to do,
and accordingly the amount of fuel necessary for
the engine should be in proportion to the amount
of work that the engine is called on to perform.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eat Less,
Exercise
More.</div>

<p>The majority of city-dwelling people eat too
much. This is especially true of men in seden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>tary
occupations, and women whose
household duties are light. If your
engine needs twenty pounds of steam,
how foolish it is to keep up a hundred pounds
pressure! If you had five-horsepower work to
perform, how foolish it would be to install a two-hundred-and-fifty-pound
engine!</p>

<p>Eat less of everything. Fat and flabbiness and
over-feeding is a national vice with us. The fashionable
caf&eacute;s and restaurants are thronged with
puffy, heavy-jowled men and women, eating and
drinking. Hotels and food-purveyors are constantly
inventing new palate-tickling dishes to
tempt your appetite. Orchestras and dramatic
troupes are engaged to entertain and amuse you
while you overload your stomach, take on fat, and
lay the foundation for future cases of indigestion
or dyspepsia.</p>

<p>There is no escaping a day of reckoning for
such mistreatment of yourself. If you would keep
yourself fit, it is important that you eat only what
is necessary to maintain yourself at normal
weight and strength.</p>

<p>You do not often find dyspepsia or indigestion
among men or women who work hard physically.
Isn't it reasonable to suppose that this is because
they work hard?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>You who work indoors, with little physical exercise,
will find wonderful benefits if you will cut
down the fuel.</p>

<p>Much of the physical trouble comes from filling
up the boiler too much.</p>

<p>Cut down the food and you will feel better.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<h2>38.</h2>


<p>Anger and revenge are great pull-backs to
health.</p>

<p>Anger makes the blood rush to the head, weakens
the body, and distorts the vision.</p>

<p>When a woman gets angry, she quarrels with
her lover, her husband or her children. Any one
of these things is a calamity.</p>

<p>When a man gets angry, he is a wild man. His
eyes glitter, his mouth is cruel, his fists clinch,
his body trembles, his blood veins strain, and he
does more harm to his system in five minutes of
anger than nature can repair in a day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anger
and Poise.</div>

<p>Anger makes weak stomachs, dizzy heads, poor
judgment, lost friends, despair and sickness, and
if the habit becomes confirmed, will
likely lead to apoplexy. When two
men have differences, watch the cool
man finish victor; the angry man always loses.
Keep your head; let the other fellow fret and
fume.</p>

<p>He will tie himself up in a knot, and when the
gong is rung, he will be the loser.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>Serenity is one of God's blessings. Fortunate
is the man who can hold his serenity.</p>

<p>When you get a letter that stirs you to anger,
don't answer that letter for forty-eight hours,
then write a moderately vitriolic letter&mdash;and
then tear it up.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Futility
of Revenge.</div>

<p>I know you are tempted and goaded, and your
limit of endurance is sometimes reached. But I
know that revenge is sweet only in
anticipation. I know that revenge by
anger and by the cruel "eye for an
eye" measure is never, never sweet.</p>

<p>I have been the victim of imposition, ingratitude
and insincerity, and advantage has been
taken of me because I kept my poise and serenity.</p>

<p>I have been called easy, and soft, and friends
have shown me where I was imposed upon, but
I was stooping to conquer. I kept my reserve,
my resistance, and my power ready until time,
place, and preparedness let me spring my coup,
and then I cashed in beautifully in principal and
interest for those acts and hurts.</p>

<p>I have power now in my hands to make others
suffer keenly and deeply for wrongs they have
done me. Yet I do not exercise that power to
revenge.</p>

<p>I have been misjudged and misunderstood, be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>cause
cowardly persons have lied and villified me,
and have accused me of motives and acts of which
I was innocent.</p>

<p>I am well hated now by one person in particular,
who blames me for things another is guilty
of. A word from me would clear myself, but it
would bring gloom and despair to that person and
would not make me any more cognizant of my
innocence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Time, the
Arbiter.</div>

<p>Time somehow will bring out the truth; the
cowardly, guilty individual who basks in the
favor of the one who is angry at me
will surely pay for his wrong. This
I know, and I am satisfied with the
ultimate result.</p>

<p>My former friend, who is angry at me, would
simply switch the anger current to the guilty one
if I told the facts; the guilty person couldn't
stand that anger like I can. My act would break
up a home and bring misery. The satisfaction I
would receive would not equal the sorrow my act
would cause to others.</p>

<p>I am far removed from the location where these
people live, and I can stand the anger of the one
who puts the blame on me by accepting the lies
of another as truth.</p>

<p>I have the documents in black and white, yet I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
don't use them because I have poise and the consciousness
of knowing I am right, and those who
are dear to me know it, too.</p>

<p>I've tried both plans, the plan of anger and the
plan of poise, and I like poise better.</p>

<p>I believe I hear more birds, I believe I get more
pleasure out of life and living than the man who
gets angry and loves revenge.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think so, and "as a man thinketh in
his heart, so is he."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>Sleeping, like breathing and digesting, is controlled
by the subconscious brain centers. Natural
sleep requires no positive mental impulse; it's
just relaxing, and nature takes care of the process.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Can't Sleep.</div>

<p>That is natural sleep, but when you start your
dry cell battery, the brain, and commence to worry
and fear, you are going to stay awake.
Then the conscious mind dominates
the subconscious mind, and you banish the very
comforter you seek to woo.</p>

<p>Business men who work under high tension all
day on business matters, and high tension all
evening in threshing over again the business of
the day, are almost sure to suffer from insomnia.</p>

<p>The continuance of this habit of thinking of
business day and night brings on the insomnia
habit and that, in turn, gives rise to the delusion
that you are fighting for your natural sleep. This
produces worry, the demon that kills and maims.</p>

<p>To have an occasional wakeful night is natural;
it is an evidence of intelligence: the mental dullard
never has wakeful nights.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>Unless the fear of sleeplessness becomes a full
grown phobia, no anxiety need be felt. The fear
of insomnia, the over-anxiety to go to sleep, is to
be more dreaded than insomnia itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To Get
Results.</div>

<p>To get refreshing sleep you must put yourself
in a state of actual physical tiredness. Take exercise.
Walk in one direction until
the first symptoms of becoming tired
appear, then walk home. Take a hot
bath, then sponge with cold or cool water. Put
a cold cloth at the head, and rub the backbone
with cold water.</p>

<p>Open your windows wide, then relax. Don't
worry; you are going to sleep.</p>

<p>Lie on your back, open your eyes wide, look up
as if you were trying to see your eyebrows, hold
your eyes open this way ten to twenty seconds,
then close them slowly. Repeat this several
times.</p>

<p>Sleep will have descended on you before you
realize it.</p>

<p>Or occupy your mind with auto-suggestions
like this: "I am going to sleep&mdash;sound, heavy,
restful, peaceful sleep. My eyelids are getting
heavy&mdash;heavy. I am going to close them and go
to sleep."</p>

<p>Don't try to count imaginary sheep jumping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
over fence rails. Don't count numbers. It is a
bad habit.</p>

<p>If these suggestions do not help you the first
night, say: "All right, my brain was too active;
to-morrow I will let down a bit."</p>

<p>Next night eat one or two dry crackers; chew
them slowly, masticate them thoroughly until
you can swallow easily.</p>

<p>This little food will draw the blood pressure
from the brain and help you to go to sleep.</p>

<p>Drive out business and worry thoughts. Think
faith and courage thoughts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>To live down the past and erase the errors, live
the present boldly.</p>

<p>Do not chastise or condemn yourself for mistakes
you have made. You are not alone; everyone
has made missteps&mdash;has hurt others or
wronged himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Making
Mistakes.</div>

<p>Everyone has had reverses and met trouble and
misfortune. It's the plan of things. It is by undergoing
trials like these that we gain
in experience and wisdom. We are
enabled to correct our future acts by
utilizing the lessons which our mistakes have
taught us.</p>

<p>Yesterday is dead; forget it. Face about. Live
to-day; be busy, be active, be intent on doing
right and accomplishing things worth while.</p>

<p>The world's memory is short. A misdeed, an
error, a wrongful act on your part may set busy
tongues wagging to-day, and you may suffer from
calumny and criticism. Of course, your errors
will be magnified and your wrongs enlarged be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>yond
the truth; that's the penalty you pay for
your transgressions.</p>

<p>Lies are always added to truth in telling of
one's misdeeds. Be brave. Weather the storm;
it will soon blow over. To-morrow the world will
forget.</p>

<p>You've suffered in your own conscience; that's
all the debt you can pay on the old score.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Worrying
Won't Help.</div>

<p>Now, then, get busy with the glorious opportunity
that today presents. Don't make the same
mistake again. There are no eyes
in the back of your head; look forward.
Don't worry by envying the
other fellow and comparing his good deeds with
your mistakes; you only see his good. He has
had troubles and made mistakes, too, but you and
the world have forgotten them.</p>

<p>If every man's sins were printed on his forehead,
the crowds that pass by would all wear
their hats over their eyes.</p>

<p>I'm trying to comfort you, and slap you on the
back, and tell you that you are just human, and
all humans make false steps.</p>

<p>The patriarchs in the Bible made mistakes, but
they got in the fold. History has perpetuated
their names. Their lives, on the whole, were
worth while. It's the sum total of acts that count.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<h2>41.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">To-day and
To-morrow.</div>

<p>One man says the present is everything, that
eternity is nothing. The other man says eternity
is everything, that the present is nothing.
I believe the real truth is that
both are man's chief concern, and
neither view comprehends all truth. In this matter,
the general rule I have so often pointed out
will harmoniously apply. That rule is: Avoid
extremes.</p>

<p>Those who believe that the Now, the Present,
is the all-important thing in man's life have the
fashionable or favorite point of view.</p>

<p>Man has much definite information about the
present, he knows much about life. He is in the
midst of life&mdash;it pulsates all around him and in
him.</p>

<p>We know positively that the law of compensation
is inexorable in its demand for right and positive
in its punishment of wrong.</p>

<p>We know that on this earth kindness, love, occupation,
help, truth, honor and sympathy are investments
which bring happiness to-day. You get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
your pay instantly when you have done a helpful
act, and you get your punishment instantly when
you have done a hurtful act.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hereafter.</div>

<p>That there is a future most of us agree, because
good sense and logic point to that sane and reasonable
conclusion. So be it. With
a belief in the future estate, it is reasonable
to assume that our acts and
lives in the present will have influence on our future
estate.</p>

<p>We know positively of to-day; we know the
happiness we can get from good deeds done to-day.
We come to this knowledge by experience.</p>

<p>If we will have power in the future to look back
on to-day's acts, well and good if to-day's acts are
worth while.</p>

<p>The other view, that Eternity is everything and
the present is nothing, is the antiquated view, the
narrow view&mdash;the, I might say, illiterate view.</p>

<p>That view warps the present life; it calls for
present self-chastisement, present gloom, present
sorrow and present misery.</p>

<p>It takes the tangible definite to-day, calls it
nothing, and accepts the intangible unknown eternity
as everything.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Cheerless
Philosophy.</div>

<p>It trades the definite for the indefinite. It calls
life a bubble, a vapor, a shadow. In fact, it throws
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>a pall over to-day's sunshine, and regards
our earthly life as a sort of purgatory&mdash;a
dismal unhappy punishment
ante-chamber where man exists and waits,
peeping out of his cell windows for a little imagined
view of eternity.</p>

<p>He waits and endures the unpleasant interval,
steeled against the definite pleasures of to-day,
his whole outlook colored by a fanatical and intoxicated
belief in the expected happiness of the
undefined future.</p>

<p>He refuses to think of the definite life of to-day
that we all know, and spoils the thought of those
who do.</p>

<p>He is a blockade to progress, a disagreeable
part of life's picture.</p>

<p>He gets no happiness in the to-day which is in
his hands; he loses his opportunity to be of service
here, and lives in the hope of a vague and nebulous
future state which has no connection with
the realities of every-day life.</p>

<p>Both theories as ultimate beliefs are wrong, yet
each has some truth in its conclusion.</p>

<p>By taking the words "Eternity" and "Present"
and saying that both mean everything, we
avoid extremes and form a truth that is rational,
and harmonious to good reason.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>The man who says that the present is all, does
so because he is an utilitarian. He reasons from
the definite and the seeable, and refuses to believe
in the abstract. Anything that is outside
the sphere of his vision and action is of little
concern to him.</p>

<p>The man who says eternity is all, wastes a
golden opportunity and warps himself into a miserable
hermit.</p>

<p>Life is irrevocable. Every act in our life is
placed, set, and fixed.</p>

<p>Every act goes in the record book of yesterday,
and it cannot be changed.</p>

<p>Acts that hurt others will rebound and hurt
us. Deeds that help others will rebound and
help us. This much is certain.</p>

<p>There is a future, I believe that. There is a
God, I believe that.</p>

<p>Just what the future is, and just what God is,
I do not know in perfect detail.</p>

<p>Reward for good and punishment for evil is
part of God's plan, and I am conscious of this
truth.</p>

<p>I know that justice prevails in this life, and this
life is what I am living now.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The  Good
That Lies
at Hand.</div>

<p>If I live and act to-day in accordance with what
I sincerely believe is in tune with God's purpose,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>I shall, in my future estate, benefit by
those acts. If I live and act to-day in
disregard of all around me, selfishly
catering to my personal desires and believing that
eternity is everything and the present nothing, I
am neglecting the opportunity to do good now in
the hope of a future personal reward, the very
nature of which is unknowable. I shall therefore
strive to do, and to be, right&mdash;to be kind,
helpful, cheery and smiling now, for the reward
such acts bring now.</p>

<p>And I shall doubtless have as good a record and
passport to the future as the man who suffers now
and lives only upon his selfish hope of the future.</p>

<p>His is the faith of fear, mine the faith of reason
in the all-wise, all-powerful, all-seeing, all-knowing
Ruler of the universe, who gave me my life,
my brain, my reason, which I am trying to use, as
well as my limitations will permit, in helping myself
and helping others to smile, to be happy, to
be serene, to be confident, to be competent, to be
useful.</p>

<p>Everything lives and dies in accordance with
the plan of the Creator of the Universe, and you
are an atom and I am an atom in that Universe,
which is governed by a power too big and too
great for us to comprehend.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>Verily we presume when we say: "We have all
the truth; think as we do or you are lost."</p>

<p>The old world has not told its full story. The
Universe of which this world is a part is still a
deep, unfathomable mystery.</p>

<p>We shall not know all truth until the great revealing
time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Use
of To-day.</div>

<p>We cannot change the pages of the millions of
years gone by. We can do every little to change
the pages of the millions of years to
come. What little we can do, we can
only do TO-DAY. To-day is yours
and mine; let's do the best we can with our possession
in act and thought and word.</p>

<p>The sun goes down behind the sky-line on the
West as it has done for millions of years. I lay
aside my pen with a bigger view, a deeper appreciation
of the Creator, and a profounder faith in
His wisdom and works than ever.</p>

<p>God made. God rules. God plans. And verily,
we are weaklings and foolish who presume by selfish
prayer to suggest to Him what He shall do.</p>

<p>Let us strive to be appreciative of Him; let us
try to lift ourselves to the sublime plane of realizing
that we are part of Him and His plan, and
that failure is impossible to us, if we keep up and
on, doing good, speaking softly, dealing gently,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
showing kindness to-day, and living in accordance

<h2>42.</h2>


<p>"I believe in him because he is so sincere."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sincerity
and Truth.</div>

<p>You've heard that, haven't you? I never could
understand how a sensible person could use such
logic. Sincerity is no evidence of
truth. The Hindu mother is sincere
when she throws her babe to the crocodiles,
but her sincerity is no proof that by this
sacrifice she is sure of her salvation.</p>

<p>The Christian Scientist is sincere in the belief
that medicines do not cure diseases. The doctor
is equally sincere in his belief that medicines do
cure disease.</p>

<p>The Theosophist is sincere, the Atheist, the
Agnostic, the Christian, the Pagan, the Mohammedan,
the Buddhist, the Sunworshipper, the Republican,
the Democrat, the Progressive, the Prohibitionist,
the Brewer, all these are sincere in
their beliefs. And as these beliefs are different,
it is common sense to say that no one creed, sect,
belief, branch, dogma or system includes or embodies
all truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No Monopoly
on Truth.</div>

<p>It is true that every channel or avenue we meet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>in life's travel has some truth, but it is not for you
or me to assume that we are the sole
possessors of wisdom and the real discoverers
of all truth. We must not
take the conclusions we arrive at and expect to
force the world to accept without protest our
rules for conduct, our methods for living, our
practices for morals, or our beliefs for their guidance.</p>

<p>Converts to new doctrines, new issues, new
cults, and to the old ones, too, are made largely
because the ambassadors or proselyters seem so
fervid and sincere in expounding what they claim
is the definite truth.</p>

<p>The believers in a cult or code of ethics are
auto-hypnotized; their visions are narrowed.</p>

<p>By focusing their thought on their special belief,
they bring together sophistry, argument, example
and so-called proof that gives them facility
in arguing the case or expounding their doctrine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christian
Science.</div>

<p>You can make no gain in trying to argue with
a Christian Scientist. You ask for concrete rules,
definite answers and proofs other
than their flat statements, and you
are told you have not the understanding&mdash;you
do not view the subject from the right
plane, and that the truth cannot be shown you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
You are told to have faith and belief, to eliminate
antagonism, and to study "Science and Health,"
and you will receive the divine spirit and see the
light.</p>

<p>The Scientist is sincere; he shows you "Science
and Health" with a lot of testimonials in the back
to prove that Christian Science cures disease.
Every patent medicine, every science, every system
of healing has testimonials by the hundreds.</p>

<p>Scientists say there is no disease, no material&mdash;that
we are only spirit or soul or thought&mdash;that
we are not matter but mind. Health, they
tell us, is truth and disease is error. They deny
disease, yet "Science and Health" and the midweek
experience meetings have testimonials of
disease cured by Christian Science.</p>

<p>There is much truth in Christian Science. People
are helped by it; people are sincere in their
belief in it, but that Christian Science is all truth,
all-powerful, all-right, all-sufficient, cannot be
proven.</p>

<p>What about the people who have gone hence
before Christian Science was ever heard of?</p>

<p>The theological religion of to-day differs radically
in practice and belief from what it was fifty
years ago.</p>

<p>If the Protestant religion be all truth, what be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>came
of our religious ancestors who died before
Martin Luther found the truth?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Spirit
of Tolerance.</div>

<p>I have no quarrel with the Christian Scientist,
the Protestant, the Roman Catholic, the Buddhist
or the Mohammedan. I must be generous
and broad enough to admit that
others have the right to think and be
sincere. All sciences have truth, but no science,
sect, cult, dogma or creed is ALL truth.</p>

<p>Sincerity is evidence of honest conviction, but
that your sincerity in your belief must be accepted
by me as proof that I should believe as
you do, is, I believe, the place where I have the
undoubted right to say: "I reserve the right to
my own conclusions, and I would be unjust to
myself if I should force myself to accept your
viewpoint without fully satisfying myself that
you were right."</p>

<p>So, because a person is sincere in a conviction
that is contrary to your conscientious belief, do
not be disturbed. There is no need to swerve from
your own common sense analysis of the matter,
or be convinced against your better judgment.</p>

<p>No one possesses all the truth. It is for you
and me to do our plain duty as we see it&mdash;to do
the best we can each day in act and thought and
word.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>We can pretty much agree on the simple essential
truths which are proven. That is&mdash;being honest,
truthful, kind, lovable, sympathetic, cheerful;
doing good, helping one another, and doing things
worth while.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unprofitable
Speculation.</div>

<p>If we agree on these things, and do useful work,
and think helpful thoughts, we are doing our duty.
Theories, arguments and studying too
deeply on bootless systems, codes, beliefs,
cults, isms and doctrines, is a
waste of time. When we can, here and now, derive
definite benefits from doing the simple and
helpful things, and acting and thinking the simple,
practical cheer thoughts, it is neither necessary
nor helpful for us to waste time on spiritualism
or theoretical beliefs that cannot be proven to
our own satisfaction.</p>

<p>We are asked to believe these strange, impractical,
unnatural beliefs because of the sincerity of
others. It's better to believe and to credit the
things we can ourselves measure, understand and
sincerely adopt.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of strange beliefs and spiritual
systems, each claiming to be all-powerful,
all-right. If any one is all truth, then all the others
are all wrong.</p>

<p>The bigot who assumes he is the sole possessor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
of truth&mdash;the cult, sect, ism, or science that
claims to possess all truth and presumes to lay
down the exact rules for the world to obey&mdash;should
be classed with those misguided religions
and institutions of the dark past which burned
human beings who dared to doubt their claim to
the possession of all truth and knowledge.</p>

<p>God never gave his approval to any one man-made
religious sect.</p>

<p>God is the universal good power. Man often
tries to dwarf God's idea to the narrow dimensions
of his own small soul.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Whiskey and
Fake Medicines.</div>

<p>Whiskey must go. It is written on the pages
of the record book of man's progress. Likewise
must the quack doctor and the fake
medicine go.  They have had their
day. The quack doctor has already
breathed his last in many parts of the country.
The fake medicine schemes are still with us, but
they are becoming increasingly difficult to put
over. That they are doomed to extinction, there
can be no doubt.</p>

<p>The side-whiskered advertising doctor who
magnifies symptoms and proclaims them to be
grave forerunners of awful, debilitating disease, is
nothing short of a criminal. He is one of the
worst of criminals, because he imposes upon the
credulity of the ignorant, excites their fear by
means of sensational scarehead advertising, and
then when he has finally lured them into his spider-web,
fleeces them unmercifully. These charlatans
are really more contemptible than any
thief, for the thief does not pretend to be anything
else but what he is, while the quack doctor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
swindles and exploits you under the guise of being
your benefactor.</p>

<p>As I have repeatedly explained, illness, feeling
"out of sorts," local pains and sickness, unless of
the contagious or infectious kind, are largely conditions
of the mind.</p>

<p>Most of the temporary ailments are caused by
constipation, wrong diet or lack of exercise. The
doctor gives a laxative, nature re-asserts herself,
and the patient is cured.</p>

<p>Chronic ailments require long treatments&mdash;making
long bills and many visits for the quack
doctor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Your Family
Physician.</div>

<p>Your health and happiness are things largely
in your own control. However, when you feel
you must have a doctor, go to your
family physician and not to a strange
doctor who advertises. His advertisement
is merely a spiderweb to catch and hold
you while he robs you.</p>

<p>It is a hopeful sign of the brighter future
toward which man is progressing, that the respectable
papers will not lend their aid to swindling
doctors. The best papers will not carry
these quack doctor or fake medicine ads.</p>

<p>Before long the government will pass laws abolishing
this baneful, shameful, quack advertising.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Quack doctoring, gambling, liquor selling&mdash;these
are all swindling methods to get money, and
in the getting, the ghouls and parasites who practise
these "professions" are killing men, ruining
homes, destroying happiness, holding back progress.</p>

<p>The one object of the quack doctor is to size
you up and see what you "are good for." "Good
for" means how much money can he get from
you, and how long can he keep you as a patient
to contribute to his coffers.</p>

<p>Let every reader of this book enroll as an
opponent to quack doctors and quack medicines,
and by word and influence help to hasten the day
when such pernicious swindlers and swindling
schemes are things of the past.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<h2>44.</h2>


<p>No two minds can see the same picture in the
same way, nor can two persons, armed and
equipped with logic, come to the same definite
conclusions on religion.</p>

<p>The old Scripture said: "An eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth." The new Scripture
teaches us to "turn the other cheek" and "love
our enemies."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion, Old
and New.</div>

<p>Two hundred years ago witchcraft was practised
and miserable human beings were burned
at the stake. Thirty years ago the
preacher who took exception to the
universal belief of a hell of fire and
brimstone was thrown out of the church. To-day
no preacher believes in such a hell.</p>

<p>Present day religion is really a Sunday religion.
One and a half hours a week the members of
the church join in singing, "We shall know each
other there." The remainder of the week they
make it a point to keep from knowing each
other here.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sectarianism.</div>

<p>The Protestant church divides itself into
nu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>merous sects, each one built on some particular
ordinance or practice. Each one, in
matters of doctrine, will swallow a
camel but will strain at a gnat. One sect insists
that baptism shall be by immersion because the
disciples baptized that way. They believe in following
custom literally, yet in the cities they
immerse the members in a big tub under the
pulpit, which practice is entirely different from
the method employed by John the Baptist.</p>

<p>Another sect insists upon having a communion
every Sunday because the Bible says, "As often
as you do this," etc. To be literal in the matter
of communion, the Lord's Supper should be
served at night, as the original was, and it should
be supper and not a few pieces of broken crackers.</p>

<p>The sect that insists on following the Scriptures
in the matter of baptism by immersion fails
to follow the Scriptures in the matter of washing
the feet or anointing the head.</p>

<p>Many years ago, churches considered it a sacrilege
to use an organ. To-day they have orchestras
and hire operatic singers.</p>

<p>So it seems that the church is broadening
out. Thinking men refuse to believe that religion
should any longer be a matter of self-chastisement
and worry, sobs and misery. Because so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
much of this sort of teaching is prevalent, the
church is not making the gains it should. The
church is largely supported by nice little women&mdash;many
of them maiden ladies who have little
to do and know little of the great problems of
the busy world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Live
Religion.</div>

<p>I am thoroughly convinced that the church
must recognize that a great evolution is taking
place&mdash;that we must be more charitable,
more broad in our views, less
technical in our tenets and more
practical in our work. We will have to cut down
the fences between the sects and get together in
the great field for a common cause, rather than
try to maintain little independent vineyards.</p>

<p>Religion must teach smiles and joy, courage
and brotherly love, instead of frowns, dejection,
fear and worry.</p>

<p>It must teach us how to be and how to get
good out of our to-day on earth. If we are good
and do good here, we certainly need have no
fear for our future prospects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Universal
Church.</div>

<p>Day by day we are progressing from narrowness,
bigotry, selfishness and envy, to broadness,
reason, brotherly love and contentment, and we
shall progress from the narrow confines of obstinate
orthodoxy or bulldogmatics, by breaking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>down sect and cult barriers until we are joined
together in a universal church in
which all can put their hearts and beliefs&mdash;in
which all can find full
range for their spiritual belief and expression.
That big, broad, right church will be in harmony
with God's purpose.</p>

<p>The Creator made all men, and He doesn't confine
His love or His interest to any one little man-made,
narrow sect or creed.</p>

<p>"God is love." "Love thy neighbor." "Help
the weak; cheer the grief stricken." Those are
the commands and purposes we find everywhere
in the Scriptures.</p>

<p>"He that believeth in me shall be saved."
That's a definite promise, and it is not qualified by
a lot of creed paragraphs and beliefs. That promise
doesn't have any "buts" or "ifs." It doesn't
say we shall be saved if we be Methodists or
Catholics, Baptists or Presbyterians. Those
names are man-made, and the creeds of those
churches are man-made, too.</p>

<p>At the congress of religions in the World's Fair
at Chicago, over three hundred religions and sects
were represented by delegates from all over the
world, and every one of these delegates, with
hearty accord, sang, "Praise God From Whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
All Blessings Flow" and "Rock of Ages." Those
hymns were universal; they fitted all creeds and
sects.</p>

<p>Big men in the church are intensely interested
in the get-together universal church, and each
year will mark a definite progress toward amalgamation
of sects and divisions.</p>

<p>There should be no Methodist Church North
and Methodist Church South.</p>

<p>There should not be churches like the Congregational
and Presbyterian, whose creeds are identical,
the difference being only in the officers.</p>

<p>The country village of 1,000 population has
five churches; it should have only one. The
country is full of half-starved preachers and weak,
struggling congregations.</p>

<p>The get-together movement will help religion,
and it's going to happen surely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>Every year the business man goes over his
stock, tools, fixtures, and accounts, and prepares
a statement of assets and liabilities so as to get
a fairly accurate understanding of his profit and
loss.</p>

<p>If he didn't take this inventory, his net worth
would be a matter of guess work.</p>

<p>This inventory, which deals with money, materials,
etc., and things which are mixed more or
less with the human element, is affected by conditions
of trade, crops, competition, supply and
demand.</p>

<p>The business man takes all these conditions
into consideration in preparing for the coming
year. He red flags the mistakes and green flags
the good plans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Self
Inventory.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Listing the
Liabilities.</div>

<p>The business man should carry the inventory
further. Every month or so he should take a
careful inventory of himself, putting
down his assets of health, initiative,
patience, ability to work, smiles, honesty,
sincerity, and the like. So also he should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>put down on the debit side in the list of liabilities
the pull-backs, hindrances and other business-killers.
These items are untruth,
unfairness, sharp practice,
grouchiness, impatience, worry, ill-health,
gloom, meanness, broken word, unfilled
promises and the like.</p>

<p>In making up the inventory, pay particular
attention to your habits: smoking, drinking, over-eating,
useless display, useless social functions,
and other useless things that pull on your nerves
and your pocket book.</p>

<p>Then check up department A, which is your
family. How have you dealt with your family
and children?</p>

<p>Department B is friends. How do you stand
in your treatment of them?</p>

<p>Department C includes all other persons. Did
you lie to, steal from, cheat or defraud any one?
How much cash profit did you make? How much
less a man did the act make you?</p>

<p>Go over your self-respect account. Does it
show profit or loss?</p>

<p>Check up your employees' account. What has
your stewardship shown? Have you drawn the
employees closer, or have you driven them further
from you?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>Analyze your spiritual account. Is your religious
belief a sham or a conviction? Do you
sing on Sunday, "We shall know each other
there," or do you make it a point to know and
love your brother here, seven days a week?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Balancing the
Statement.</div>

<p>Be fair in your inventory. Write down the
facts in the two columns designated "good"
and "bad," then go over the list and
put a red danger flag on the bad.
Keep the list until next inventory and
see whether you have made a gain or loss in
your net moral standing.</p>

<p>Don't read this and say, "A good idea." Do
the thing literally.</p>

<p>Take a clean sheet of paper and write your personal
assets and liabilities down in the two columns
marked "good" and "bad."</p>

<p>If this inventory doesn't help, then you may
call me a false prophet.</p>

<p>I know the plan is a good one. I know it will
help you. If it helps you, you will thank me.
There can be no harm in trying, because it's a
worth-while thing to test.</p>

<p>The ego is in us. It is a good thing to have,
but egotism needs the soft pedal when we speak
or do things.</p>

<p>Many people are unconscious of their egotism,
yet their conversation carries the suggestion,
"Even I, who am superior to the herd, would do
this or that."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Personal
Pronoun.</div>

<p>For instance, two persons were arguing about
the merits of an inexpensive automobile. Parenthetically,
I may say that one belonged
to the Ford class, and the
other to the can't-afford class. A
can't-afford snob came to the rescue of the Ford
champion by saying, "That's a good car; why, I
wouldn't mind owning one of them myself," and
he beamed at the party with the consciousness
of having settled the matter and removed the
stigma from the Ford car.</p>

<p>This egotism often crops out when one shows
a group picture in which he appears. He doesn't
wait for you to find him; he pokes his arm over
your shoulder and says, "That's me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>To each of us, in the very nature of things, the
"I" is the center of our world. We see things
always through our I's.</p>

<p>If we wish to get along without friction, we
must remember that the other fellow has his I's
also, and when we try to make him see things
through out I's, it makes trouble.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Good

<p>The hall mark of education, refinement and
character, in the broad sense, is the ability to
exclude the personal so far as possible
from our conversation. And be

<h2>47.</h2>


<p>Four hundred and twenty-six years ago Christopher
Columbus landed on an island which he
thought was India.</p>

<p>Chris was mighty happy as he put his foot on
good old Mother Earth, not so much because he
had discovered a new way to India, as he thought,
but because his foot touched land.</p>

<p>Two days before he landed on San Salvador,
his crew pitched into him and threatened to
throw him in the sea and turn back with the ship
to Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Last
Step Counts.</div>

<p>If Chris had shown the white feather, 1492
would not be the date of the first line in the geography,
announcing the "Discovery of
America." Chris had perseverance&mdash;the
stuff that makes men successful.
He started to find India by sailing westward.
He didn't succeed in his purpose, but his determination
was rewarded just the same, for he
found a new country, and that was worth while.</p>

<p>Before he started, he was promised ten per
cent of the revenue from any lands he might dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>cover.
Just imagine what that would mean to-day.</p>

<p>Columbus had perseverance and pep, and his
unwavering fidelity to his cause brought him success
in his efforts.</p>

<p>The world has improved since 1492, but the
percentage of men who would keep everlastingly
at it like Columbus did, has not increased, perhaps.</p>

<p>Columbus sailed with three ships, the largest
sixty-six feet long. He steered in the direction
of the setting sun. His crew was 120 men. None
of them were enthusiastic at the start; all of
them disgusted, discouraged and ready to mutiny
toward the last.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Keeping
Everlastingly
at It.</div>

<p>But Christopher kept the ships pointed West,
through rain and shine, through drifting, breezeless
days and through wild stormy
nights. He kept on and on and on,
and he brought home the bacon,
which, being interpreted, means that success
crowned his efforts.</p>

<p>Perseverance and pep&mdash;when all is said and
done, these are the factors without which no
great achievement is possible.</p>

<p>It was the mileage made on October 12th, 1492,
that counted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the last step in a race that counts.</p>

<p>It is the last stroke on the nail that counts.</p>

<p>The moral is that many a prize has been lost
just when it was ready to be plucked.</p>

<p>Perseverance&mdash;patience&mdash;pluck&mdash;pep&mdash;these
are magic words. They are the "Open

<p>The man who ridicules everything is on the
toboggan slide, and he will end up by becoming
an out-and-out grouch.</p>

<p>You and I know men who never have a pleasant
word to say of anyone, or a serious commendation
of anything.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ridicule and
Humor.</div>

<p>Ridicule and sarcasm are often coated with
would-be humor, and are sometimes decked out
as puns. By and by, however, this
bias toward ridicule and sarcasm gets
to be a habit, and the coat of humor
becomes threadbare.</p>

<p>Just at this time friends depart, for the grouch
phase of the disease has started.</p>

<p>Sarcasm and ridicule are powerful weapons
when used adroitly and for good purposes. But
when sarcasm and ridicule are used constantly as
a means to generate fun, or as vehicles for humor,
then the evil commences. The fun disappears;
the sting remains.</p>

<p>People will listen to you for awhile if you good-naturedly
ridicule a thing, but when you are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
known to have the habit, that is when friends
give you the go-by.</p>

<p>Sarcasm and ridicule wound deeply; they are
hot pokers jabbed in quivering flesh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Dangerous
Weapon.</div>

<p>Don't juggle with ridicule or sarcasm, for people
look beneath the veneer nowadays. They remember
and repeat the axiom,
"There's many a true word spoken
in jest." There are so many beautiful
things to say, so many kind expressions to
utter, so many helpful hints to give, that we
should be ashamed to say or do things even jokingly
that may hurt another.</p>

<p>When you ridicule a thing or a person, you may
ridicule the tender heart of one you should cheer
and help.</p>

<p>Ridicule is the negative approach to a subject
anyway; the only good it can accomplish is by
reflex action or rebound force.</p>

<p>Ridicule is mistakenly conceived, by many, as
humor. It is used because it can so easily be
employed, in a seemingly clever way, to create a
laugh.</p>

<p>Humor of the clean sort is a rare gift. Humor
may easily descend to low comedy through the
use of ridicule, and often the audience does not
differentiate between low comedy and rare humor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>The masses will laugh when the comedian on
the stage hits his friend with a club; that sort of
fun-making satisfies adults who have children's
brains, and people of similar brain-construction
will also laugh at jokes which ride on ridicule.
But you who read these lines are worthy of better
things; that's why you are reading this book.
If, in my audience, there are those who have the
ridicule habit, I want to arouse you to a better
sense of humor than is possible through the employment
of ridicule and sarcasm.</p>

<p>I don't want you to descend to the level of the
grouch. The slide-down is so easy; the climbing
back is so very hard.</p>

<p>Ridicule and sarcasm are cheap, slap-stick
methods to produce fun. They leave a sting many
times when you are not aware of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">When You
Can Go
the Limit.</div>

<p>When fighting whiskey, sin, corruption or organized
evil, then use burning ridicule and caustic
sarcasm to sizzle and destroy the
things that need to be destroyed.
Next time you find yourself using
ridicule or sarcasm to provoke mirth, remember
you are toying with a habit-forming practice that
is likely to get the best of you unless you stop
and stop now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Your Wife
and Partner.</div>

<p>A wife is either a partner or an employee. If
a partner, she has a right to the fifty-fifty split
on profits; if an employee, she is entitled
to her wages. A thrifty husband
is commendable, but a show-me-what-you-did-with-that-money
husband should
be punished by being sentenced to attend pink
teas, afternoon receptions, and to match samples
at the dry goods store.</p>

<p>Married folks must be on a partnership basis,
or there's sand in the gear box.</p>

<p>Give the wife the check-book; let her pay the
bills. Play fair with her; show her what your
income is; give her all you can afford and what
economic and wise administration warrants.
She'll cut the cloth to fit the garment.</p>

<p>When the husband questions every turn, every
move, and doles out every cent, the wife feels
like a prisoner or a slave. Wives will do good
team work when they are broken to double harness
with their husbands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>Women are generally raised without being required
to economize. They have probably been
petted and humored, and are used to preening
and smoothing their plumage and looking pretty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fine
Feathers.</div>

<p>It's the female instinct in the human. In the
animal world, the male has the plumage and does
the strutting and fascinating; but in
the human animal, the female is the
bird with the bright plumage.</p>

<p>You can't expect her to know much about the
economic side of the home the moment you slip
the ring on her finger.</p>

<p>But she'll shop better than her husband if he
takes an interest in her shopping and encourages
her in the economical administration of the household
budget.</p>

<p>She wants a word of appreciation once in a
while. She chills under the surveillance and parsimony
of an eagle-eyed, meddlesome husband.</p>

<p>She's a sweet bird, and sweet birds and hawks
don't nest well together.</p>

<p>Where the hawk and the dove are in the same
cage, the feathers will fly.</p>

<p>As I came through the park this morning, I
saw a pair of robins who had the right idea. They
shared home responsibilities and did fine team
work. I think they were mighty happy, too;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
daddy red breast looked mighty proud as he hustled
worms for the family breakfast.</p>

<p>Mama Robin looked down with loving eyes at
her hubby, and the little baby robins sang a
chorus of joy at the very privilege of living in
such a home.</p>

<p>Worry will fly out of the window the moment
the husband and wife lay their cards on the table
and play the open hand. The moment one or the
other keeps a few cards up their sleeve, then
worry and trouble come back.</p>

<p>The moral of this is, husbands and wives: live
together, get together, stay together, play together,
save together, grow together, share together.
Travel the same road; don't take different
paths.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>To-night I am in the Ozarks, and old Mother
Earth is passing through the belt of meteoric dust&mdash;that
great mysterious sea in the universe
through which we pass every year about the middle
of November.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Stars.</div>

<p>I look out into the night and marvel at the
countless stars in the infinite black void, and
wonder how closely those stars may
be connected with humanity. That
they are connected, I have no doubt, for truly,
"the sun, the moon, the stars, and endless space
as well, are parts, are things, like me, that cometh
from and runneth by one grand power of
which I am in truth a part, an atom though I be."</p>

<p>How many stars are there? Well, let's get
ready to appreciate number. I can see about
3,000; with opera glasses I could see 30,000.</p>

<p>Franklin Adams some years ago photographed
the whole canopy with 206 exposures. He counted
the stars by mathematical plans, and published
his finding that there were 1,600,000,000 stars.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
That number is just about the number of humans
on this earth. So, then, there is one star for each
of us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Finite and
Infinite.</div>

<p>Each of those stars, practically speaking, is
larger than the earth. It is thought that many of
them may have human beings who
think and reason like we do. Multiply
the 1,600,000,000 population on
this earth by any portion of the 1,600,000,000 stars
that may have thinking creatures on them; multiply
that total by the millions of years and millions
of generations that have passed out of existence.</p>

<p>Think of these numbers and limitless boundaries,
and then tell me, if you can, that one little
man on one little star we call Earth has a strangle-hold
on truth, and that his viewpoint, his ism,
his little dogma, his narrow creed, is all-sufficient,
all-right, all-inclusive.</p>

<p>Verily, little protoplasm, you have another
guess. We can, by experience and tests, prove
two and two make four. We can by practice and
experience prove that love, kindness, help, gentleness,
sympathy, cheer and courage bring happiness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sense of
Proportion.</div>

<p>These are tangible things that fall within the
province of human experience. But when one wee
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>Willie with sober face tells you and me and others
that he has the truth about the definite,
full workings of God's plans and
purposes, I think of the greatness of
1,600,000,000 stars, each with 1,600,000,000 humans,
and of the unnumbered generations gone
by, and say that verily, we must live TO-DAY
and do the best we can to-day in act and thought
and word.</p>

<p>Yesterday is dead; to-morrow is unknown.
Where we have been, where we will be, we know
not. Where we are to-day, we know, and only
God in His omniscience knows the final answer
as to our future estate.</p>

<p>He will take us and hold us and place us in
His keeping and according to His purpose, even
though we do not or cannot follow or believe
any one of the little man-formed creeds, isms or
cults as the measure and rule for our beliefs.</p>

<p>Those stars testify to the certainty of God, and
I believe in Him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Success and
Envy.</div>

<p>When a man by his brains, or by a fortunate
combination of circumstances, rises to a position
of prominence, he becomes a target
for the envious and a pattern for the
imitator. Emulation and envy are
ever alert in trying to steal the fruits of the leader
or the doer of things.</p>

<p>The man who makes a name gets both reward
and punishment. The reward is his satisfaction
in being a producer, a help to the world, and the
glory that comes from widespread recognition and
publicity of his accomplishment. The punishment
is the slurs, the enmity, the envy and the
detraction, to say nothing of the downright lies
which are told about him.</p>

<p>When a man writes a great book, builds a great
machine, discovers a great truth or invents a useful
article, he becomes a target for the envious
many.</p>

<p>If he does a mediocre thing, he is unnoticed; if
his work is a masterpiece, jealousy wags its
tongue and untruth uses its sting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>Wagner was jeered. Whistler was called a
mere charlatan. Langley was pronounced crazy.
Fulton and Stephenson were pitied. Columbus
faced mutiny on his ship on the very eve of his
discovery of land. Millet starved in his attic.
Time has passed, and the backbiters are all in
unmarked graves. The world, until the end of
time, will enjoy Wagner's music. Whistler and
Millet's paintings attract artists from all over
the world, and inventors reverence the names of
Fulton and Stephenson.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Price of
Greatness.</div>

<p>The leader is assailed because he has done a
thing worth while; the slanderers are trying to
equal his feat, but their imitations
serve to prove his greatness. Because
jealous ones cannot equal the leader,
they seek to belittle him. But the truly worth-while
man wins his laurels and he remains a
leader. He has made his genius count, and has
given the creature of his brain and imagination
to the world.</p>

<p>Above the clamor and noise, above the din of
the rocks thrown at him, his masterpiece and his
fame endure.</p>

<p>And compensation, the salve to the sore, makes
the great man deaf to the noise and immune to
the attacks of the knockers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>In his own heart he knows he has done a thing
worth while; his own conscience is clear, and he
cares not for the estimate of the world.</p>

<p>His own character is his chief concern, and he
is content in the knowledge that time will bring
its reward.</p>

<p>If you have high ideals in business, if you
achieve success on a big scale, mark well, you
will be a subject of attacks, of lies, of malice, of
envy, of disreputable competition. There is no
way out of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Compensation.</div>

<p>But you will be repaid. The lover of fair play,
the grateful, true, honest, worth-while people will
flock to your standard; the riff-raff
will skulk behind bushes and throw
rocks and mud, but their acts will prove to the
great mass of the people that your purposes, practices
and policies are right.</p>

<p>Therefore, courage is to be your chief asset;
patience, pride, perseverance, your lieutenants.</p>

<p>Be not weary, grow not discouraged when your
progress is hampered by obstacles. Every truly
great man of the past has had his backbiters and
detractors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<h2>52.</h2>


<p>There are three periods in our lives: the youthful,
or prospective period, the adult, or introspective
period, and the old age, or retrospective
period.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Growing Old.</div>

<p>Too many there are who look forward to old
age with fear or dread. But old age has its joys
and pleasures as well as middle age
and youth, and these pleasures are
the keener if the first and second periods
of life were lived sanely, worthily and properly.
Numerous are the great men of the past who
have extolled the old-age period of human life
with its wisdom and wealth of worldly experience.</p>

<p>If the middle period is spent in getting dollars
only, then old age will be days of empty nothingness.</p>

<p>Youth is the planning time&mdash;the time for
ideals and ambitions; middle age the building
time, and old age the dividend time.</p>

<p>With many, old age is spent in reading the
book of the past&mdash;with sadness as the reader<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
recognizes that the ideals, plans and hopes were
shattered. As age turns the page in the book
of the past, he reads one hope after another vanished
in smoke.</p>

<p>Anticipation is seldom realized, and this is as
it should be, for in time, men will learn to live
each day for each day's good and each day's happiness.</p>

<p>Let us perform our duty to-day; let us lay
away a kindly act, a smile, a word of cheer in
the bank of good deeds.</p>

<p>Each of us has a share in this world's work. It
matters little whether our actual share is what
we had guessed or wished it to be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Value
of Ideals.</div>

<p>Vicissitudes will cross our path here and there;
so-called misfortune or bad luck will strike us
when least expected. The failure of
our dreams should not grieve us. We
cannot reach up and grasp the stars,
but like the pilot at the wheel at sea, we can
steer by those stars that help us on our way.</p>

<p>Our ideal may not be realized, but the journey
to it may still be a pleasant one.</p>

<p>Our ideals, plans and hopes had a real purpose,
a real service; they gave us courage and made us
work, and thus they were well worth while.</p>

<p>We must not, in the old age period, condemn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
ourselves because our plans failed or our castles
were shattered.</p>

<p>There is no hard luck except incurable disease
or death. It is not for us to mourn the past or
weep for the flowers that are gone.</p>

<p>In our active days, we should realize that we
are putting memories away in our brains that
will come back to us in old age.</p>

<p>Only that which we put in our brains can we
take out.</p>

<p>So then, Mr. Avarice, I warn you: If gold is
your God, it's cold comfort you will get in your
sunset days.</p>

<p>Build up loving ties, appreciation and the
worth-while riches of good deeds, and in your
evening of life, you will be welcome wherever
you go.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Put Not
Your Faith
in Gold.</div>

<p>If your life was sold for gold, your evening of
life will be short and miserable; legatees will
grudge you your every breath; they
will endure you simply because they
are checking off the days from Time's
calendar until the day of your passing, and the
dollars you sold your soul and heart and life
for, will be lavishly spent by cold-blooded heirs
who cared nothing for you.</p>

<p>Leave a legacy of love, example and character,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
and if, with these, there are a few dollars, they
simply prove your frugality, economy and independence.</p>

<p>A few dollars left to heirs will help. Many
dollars will hurt. Dollars in old age will give
you pleasure by helping in tight corners. They
will enable you to help your loved ones over the
bumps in the road.</p>

<p>Use the dollars to help those you love to help
themselves, and your old age will be a busy,
happy one, and you won't be in the way.</p>

<p>To prepare for that happy period of your life,
the foundation must be built in the active to-day
period.</p>

<p>Carry smiles into your old age; they will keep
the heart young, the digestion good, and life will
be worth while.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<h2>53.</h2>


<p>I have traveled horseback over the great arid
plains of the West, and have read the story of
the ages gone before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Remote
Past.</div>

<p>In Arizona and New Mexico there are ancient
ruins of forts and cities built by people we know
not of. Chalcedony Park with its
petrified forest of mammoth trees silently
testifies to a period when vegetation
was rampant on what is now a desert.</p>

<p>In Wyoming there is coal enough to furnish
fuel for the United States for several centuries.</p>

<p>Coal is carbon made from decayed trees and
vegetation, which became covered with earth and
rock, and was subjected to tremendous pressure
throughout the thousands of years required to
effect the transformation.</p>

<p>Oceans and floods gradually covered millions
of acres of trees and plants with ooze and soil
and sand. Ages turned some of these deposits
to stone.</p>

<p>There in bleak Wyoming is testimony and evidence
of changes that time only can bring about.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>"A thousand years is as a day and a day is as
a thousand years." Thus wrote the scribe of old.
So, then, we must consider this estimate of time
in reading the first chapter of Genesis which describes
the order of the world's creation.</p>

<p>First took place the dividing of light from darkness,
thus bringing about the rotation of day and
night.</p>

<p>Then, the separating of land and water; then,
the birth of vegetation on the land, the creation
of fish and reptiles in the sea, the fowls of the
air, the beasts of the field, and finally, the higher
animal, man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Measure
of Time.</div>

<p>The pages of the earth's surface carry in their
stratification indelible records harmonizing with
this scriptural account of the evolution
of the earth from its chaotic
misty past to its concrete definite
present. Yes, this earth of ours is old, so old
that mere man cannot contemplate or accurately
estimate its wondrous age.</p>

<p>The fossils of the mammoth reptiles and beasts
which lived before the appearance of man on this
planet are numerous in the fascinating West I
know so well.</p>

<p>In those arid desert hills are bones of the ancient
rhinoceros&mdash;parent of our horse&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
there are shells, and fossils of fish, and bones of
animals imbedded in the strata of rock.</p>

<p>Man reads these pages and he is lost in bewilderment,
impoverished in thought, dumb for
words, paralyzed by his inability to co-ordinate
this evidence with any measure of time that will
fall within the range of human comprehension.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Age of
the Earth.</div>

<p>Historians say the world was 4,004 years old
before the Christian era, and 1918 years have
passed since then, making the age
to date 5,922 years. It is not surprising
that through the dark ages, dates
and facts were lost. We have not a complete
history in written language, but we have some
very definite history in the rocks and hills and
lands and seas.</p>

<p>The world certainly is more than 5,922 years
old. Read the record of time so plainly visible
at Niagara Falls.</p>

<p>Niagara Falls eats away about two feet of
rock in a century; the gorge is a good many miles
long. At the present rate of erosion, it takes
2,640 years to eat away a mile. Multiply that by
the distance between the falls and Lake Ontario
and you have an idea of how many years Niagara
Falls has been at work.</p>

<p>Before Niagara Falls was in existence, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
country round about was under the sea; before
that, under glaciers; before that, in the tropics,
and I don't know how many times it has swung
on its pendulum between Frigid, Temperate and
Torrid Zones.</p>

<p>We are certain to become lost in a labyrinth
of mystery when we take these known facts concerning
the earth's age, and try to specify any
particular number of millions of years as the old
world's age.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 100%;" />
<h2>54.</h2>


<p>And now my pleasant occupation of writing
this book draws to an end. I sincerely hope you
have received some definite suggestions that will
be helpful to you.</p>

<p>To get you to think&mdash;that has been my aim.
To get you to analyze yourself&mdash;to take stock
of yourself&mdash;to know yourself&mdash;that has been
the task I set before me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How to
Think.</div>

<p>Think vital thoughts of courage, faith and hope.
Then will your days pass joyfully, and your path
be one of peace, happiness and contentment.
If you fill your mind with
gloom and sorrow thoughts, your surroundings
will reflect your mental attitude and
will accentuate your misery and dejection. Do
not give way to this weak, gloomy, pernicious
thinking. You can be strong, you will be strong
if you learn to control your thought habits.</p>

<p>Can you face disagreeable facts without wavering?
Can you meet adversity with courage in
your heart and a smile on your lips? You can,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
if you have read this book carefully, calmly,
thoughtfully, and put into practice the rules I
have laid down.</p>

<p>Do not think that you can go through life without
your share of pain, disillusion and disappointment.
It can't be done. No man has ever done
it. Clouds will come, but they can be dispelled.
Obstacles will arise, but they can be surmounted.
Troubles will visit you, but meet them boldly and
courageously and do not show the white feather.</p>

<p>To the thinking man or woman, life is a great
arena wherein good and bad, joy and sorrow,
faith and disillusion, happiness and unhappiness,
success and failure are inextricably intermingled.
The joy and happiness, accept gratefully; the sorrow
and disillusion, bear with fortitude. And
remember, although it is not possible to enjoy
an absolute and continued state of happiness, it
always lies within your power to have serenity,
poise, peace and contentment.</p>

<p>When you are in the dumps&mdash;when that feeling
of the hopelessness and un-worth-whileness
of life comes over you, then, more than ever,
<i>think</i>. Do not give way to fear and despondency.
Think cheerful thoughts; think of the good
things that life has given you, not the least
of them being life itself. Think of the ringing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>words that Milton put into the mouth of Lucifer,
the fallen angel, in "Paradise Lost":</p>

<p class="poem">
"The mind is its own place, and in itself<br />
Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven."<br />
</p>

<div class="sidenote">Life's Ever-Newness.</div>

<p>To the person who thinks, life is ever-new,
ever-interesting. If you have lost your grip on
reality&mdash;if you have dwelt too long
in the shadowland of doubt, fear and
despondency&mdash;the thing to do is to
correct your thinking. Let your mind soar in
contemplation of the beautiful things of nature.
Steel yourself against petty pull-backs and recognize
them for what they really are&mdash;trifling annoyances
that serve no purpose except to distract
you from the pursuit of the great and glorious
goal that lies ahead.</p>

<p>Only to the thinking man is it given to see
life and see it whole. He only has the true sense
of proportion. He keeps his eye on the main
objective, secure in the realization that he is
master of himself and captain of his own soul.
He is self-sufficient, for he knows that no matter
what befalls, he carries happiness and contentment
within himself wherever he goes.</p>

<p>The practice of thinking is a tower of strength.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
If you are a thinker, life's little troubles serve but
to reinforce your spirit of resistance and make
you stronger.</p>

<p>So then, let this be my last word to you&mdash;<i>think!</i>&mdash;for
it is by thinking that man has risen
to his present high estate in the world. It is by
thinking that the future joy and happiness and
peace of the world must be increased.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
